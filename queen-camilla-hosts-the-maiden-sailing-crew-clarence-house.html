Her Majesty Queen Camilla actually launched Maiden in September 2018. Since then we’ve been around the world twice, had a pandemic and raced around the world with a new young all female crew – the most diverse female crew that's ever been on a professional sailing team. And they have become the first all-female crew to win an around the world. And then she's invited us here today. It's the perfect circle."</p><p id=ezi-c6Bkdt data-wc=25>Tracy said of the Maiden’s victory: “For me it's the end of a 45 year fight for the equality of women within sailing sports generally."</p><p id=ezTxY-UUASD data-wc=34>She said of the diverse crew: "Sailing is described as male, pale and stale. So with maiden in 1989 we dealt with the male and stale bit, we didn't deal with the pale bit."</p><p id=eaNzAzW2u0 data-wc=50>She went on: "When Whoopi Goldberg became our patron, she looked me square in the eye and when she went, 'Change it', I went, 'Ok!'

I remember meeting her when she launched Maiden and she was talking about the empowerment of women. I don’t think people realise how much she does in that sphere."</p><p id=e3EYEuF7vhW data-wc=33>Asked about Najiba's story, Tracy said: "We wanted to highlight what was going on in Afghanistan. 130 million girls didn’t have an education before the pandemic and the Taliban… that number has increased."</p><p id=e8aHHgIprQC data-wc=37>Skipper Heather Thomas described the Queen's support as "massively important," adding: "We're a British vessel, we've got a lot of history in this country so to have the support of the monarchy is really important to us."</p><p id=e1SI398HraOb data-wc=32>She said: "It was amazing to bring the team and to show them off to the Queen and to get them to see the Queen and be recognised for what they've done."</p><p><b><i>LISTEN: A Right Royal Jam - and more!</i></b></p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">LOVE THE ROYALS?

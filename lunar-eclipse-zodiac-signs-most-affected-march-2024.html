If you’re feeling the cosmic whiplash already, then you might be one of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>zodiac signs affected by the full moon lunar eclipse in Libra</a> of March 2024 the most. After all, it means you’re sitting right in the eye of the storm!</p><p>Alright, real talk—there’s no reason to be afraid of an eclipse, so don’t allow the experience to fill you with dread. In astrology, eclipses open a karmic doorway <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for a period of 28-days</a>, and during this time, anything—and I mean anything—can happen. After all, an eclipse can only occur when a full moon or a new moon takes place in either of the zodiac signs situated on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the North Node</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the South Node</a>. While the North Node signifies your future and your ultimate destiny, the South Node represents the energetic baggage of your past. And if your zodiac sign happens to be affected by an eclipse, it could evoke a sharp and unexpected turning point in your life. If you’re already feeling the weight of change, don’t worry—the universe knows what it’s doing.</p><p>Sometimes, the changes that take place during eclipse season can be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">massive and completely life-altering</a>. Other times, the shift can be more subtle and internal, but also keenly felt. Regardless, this upcoming total lunar eclipse will shake up your reality one way or another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-23.png><p>Taking place on March 25 at 3 a.m. ET, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>full moon and penumbral lunar eclipse</a> will rise at 5 degrees Libra. This eclipse could have a major impact on your relationships, as Libra is the cardinal air sign of harmony, balance, and one-on-one partnerships. Opposing the sun in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>solo and independent Aries</a>, Libra represents the “other” in our lives. The blow of these changes will be softened by the fact that<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> love planet Venus</a>—Libra’s ruling planet—will be moving through Pisces, the zodiac sign of its “exaltation”. This means that right now, Venus is in a very powerful position. Although some of you may be breaking up, there’s also a good chance many of you will be making up. Because Venus will be in a conjunction with Saturn—<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>planet of karma, discipline, and maturity</a>—this next phase of your relationships will require perseverance and hard work. And as this eclipse forms a sextile <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to transformative Pluto</a>, you can expect to purge unwanted weight from your past and heal old wounds.</p><p>Because this lunar eclipse forms occurs while <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the South Node is also in Libra</a>, it will flush what is no longer meant for you down the drain. The South Node represents karma from our history and our past lives, and when it moves through Libra, it targets relationships that do not support our highest growth, as well as codependency, passivity, and people-pleasing tendencies. This lunar eclipse also takes place just before a total solar eclipse on April 8, landing at 19 degrees Aries. Because the next eclipse will rise at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the North Node</a>, it will likely call new energy, new beginnings, and new relationships into your life, as the North Node represents our future and our highest potential. Which of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the 12 astrological houses</a> are ruled by Aries and Libra <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>in your birth chart</a>? These areas of your life shine a revealing light on how these eclipses have been affecting you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=these-4-zodiac-signs-will-feel-the-lunar-eclipse-the-most>These 4 Zodiac Signs Will Feel the Lunar Eclipse the Most</h2><p>If your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon sign</a> or—most importantly—your&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following zodiac signs (especially if lands between 0 and 10 degrees), the upcoming full moon lunar eclipse in Libra could lead to a spiritual glow-up.

This person could be your significant other, your best friend, your business partner, or even your arch nemesis. No matter who it is, this eclipse is encouraging you to evolve in your relationship with this person, and the way you deal with people in general. If the situation is less than ideal, you may be ready to part ways someone due to the toxic dynamic you share. If the situation is going well, you may feel ready to further commit to this person. However, the energy of this eclipse might not be as cut and dry. Instead of a major relationship change, you may find that your perspective of relationships is shifting altogether. What can you do to improve the level of harmony that you share with others? What can you do to invite healthier and more mutually beneficial relationships in the future? No matter what happens, have faith that it is all for the highest good. It’s also out of your hands, as an eclipse always speeds you up toward your ultimate destiny and brings changes that last for at least the next six months. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full yearly horoscope for 2024</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.858407079646><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_cancer.png><p>Have you been feeling antsy in your career lately, Cancer? Are you outgrowing your current position and feeling ready for something new? All signs point to: Yes.

You may be bracing for—or getting used to—a significant turning point in your journey to success. You may put out a press release that shocks all your friends, followers, and fans. You may even surprise the world by changing career paths, accepting a promotion or leaving a job that no one was expecting you to part ways with. And because this eclipse is opposing the sun in your fourth house of home and family, you may feel the ramifications of these changes in your personal life just as much as your professional life. No matter what happens, it will open the door to so many more opportunities in the future.

That means the spotlight is on you and you’re the main character of this next era of change. Even if you’re not in the mood for all the attention this is bringing you, you have to admit that your spark is lighting quite a fire in your heart. This eclipse is bringing you to the brink of change as it pushes you out of your comfort zone and forces you to start making waves. All you have to do is let go of everything that’s currently inhibiting you from acting on your deepest instincts and expressing yourself with full authenticity. You might do something completely unpredictable (or experience something totally expected). When an eclipse takes place in your zodiac sign, it always means you’re reaching a personal milestone. However, reaching the end of one chapter also means that you’re starting the next. Expect separations and endings, but also reunions and new beginnings. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full yearly horoscope for 2024</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3328690807799><h2>Capricorn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_capricorn.png><p>Has been chaos and unpredictability been brewing at home, Capricorn?

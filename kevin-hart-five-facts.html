He is most recognized for his work as a director of science fiction, crime, and historical drama films, like the Alien film series.</p><p>His work is characterized by an ambient and highly focused visual approach. Scott has won several awards, including the BAFTA Fellowship for Lifetime Achievement in 2018, two Primetime Emmys, and a Golden Globe.&nbsp;</p><p>He has even been knighted by the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2003. Scott, a graduate of the Royal College of Art in London, began his career in television as a designer and director before going into advertising as a commercial director.&nbsp;</p><p>He made his directorial debut with The Duellists in 1977 and rose to prominence with his following feature, Alien, in 1979. The Alien film was shown in 70 mm at midnight on May 25, 1979, as the opening night of the fourth Seattle International Film Festival.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>It received negative reviews upon its first release but went on to become a box-office triumph, earning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, three Saturn Awards —&nbsp; Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Scott, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright —&nbsp; and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.</p><p>Alien’s popularity produced a media empire of films, novels, video games, and toys. The story of&nbsp;Sigourney Weaver’s character’s interactions with the alien species served as the conceptual and narrative foundation for the sequels: Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992), and Alien Resurrection (1997).&nbsp;</p><p>The Alien vs. Predator films were created through a collaboration with the Predator brand, and Scott helmed a two-film prequel series. While the Alien film franchise is not on <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/netflix/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>, there are various other movies by Scott on the streaming platform.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Here are the top five Ridley Scott movies on Netflix. <strong>Note:</strong> <strong>The availability of these movies on Netflix is based on where you live.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blade Runner: The Final Cut (1982)</h2><p>The 1982 science fiction film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blade Runner</a> was directed by Scott and written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples. It is an adaptation of Philip K. Dick’s 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos.&nbsp;</p><p>The film is set in a dystopian future Los Angeles of 2019 when the powerful Tyrell Corporation has bio-engineered synthetic people known as replicants to work on space colonies. When a crew of sophisticated replicants commanded by Roy Batty (Hauer) flees to Earth, burnt-out detective Rick Deckard (Ford) grudgingly agrees to track them down.</p><p>As a consequence of controversial alterations sought by studio management, seven separate versions of Blade Runner exist. Following a positive reaction to test screenings of a workprint, a director’s cut was released in 1992.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>This, combined with the film’s success as a video rental, made it one of the first films to be released on DVD. The Final Cut, a 25th-anniversary digitally restored version, was released by Warner Bros. in 2007; this is the only version over which Scott kept artistic control.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gladiator (2000)</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gladiator</a>, directed by Scott and written by David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson, is a 2000 epic historical drama film.

Gladiator has been critically reevaluated since its first release.&nbsp;</p><p>It is now largely regarded as one of the best films of the 2000s, as well as one of the best historical epics ever filmed. Scott recently stated that work on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sequel</a>, which is set to be published in the United States on November 22, 2024, has begun.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Counselor (2013)</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Counsellor</a> is a 2013 criminal thriller film directed by Scott and written by Cormac McCarthy.

Drew Goddard developed the script from Andy Weir’s 2011 novel of the same name.&nbsp;</p><p>The movie recounts an astronaut’s lone fight to live on Mars after being abandoned, as well as NASA’s efforts to rescue him and return him to Earth. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Chastain</a>, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Michael Pea, Kate Mara, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/sebastian-stan/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Sebastian Stan</a>, Aksel Hennie, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover, and Benedict Wong all appear in the film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>It garnered favorable reviews and earned more than $630 million worldwide, making it Scott’s highest-grossing picture to date and the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2015. The film gained critical acclaim for its directing, visual effects, musical soundtrack, narrative, scientific correctness, and likability.&nbsp;</p><p>It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and it garnered countless additional honors.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>All the Money in the World (2017)</h2><p>Ridley Scott’s 2017 biographical criminal thriller film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">All the Money in the World</a> is directed by Scott and written by David Scarpa.</p><p>Based on John Pearson’s 1995 book Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of J. Paul Getty’s Heirs, it depicts the events surrounding the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III in 1973 and his grandfather’s refusal to cooperate with the kidnappers’ extortion demands.&nbsp;</p><p>The title of the movie comes from an early conversation between Gail Harris (Getty III’s mother) and Dante ‘Cinquanta’ Agnana (one of Getty III’s abductors). When Harris states she can’t pay the ransom because she doesn’t have any money, Aganana responds angrily, “Get it from your father-in-law. He has all the money in the world.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Michelle Williams plays Gail Harris Getty, John Paul Getty III’s mother, Christopher Plummer plays Getty, and Mark Wahlberg plays Fletcher Chase, a Getty family adviser.</p><p>On December 18, 2017, the film debuted at the Samuel Goldwyn Theatre in Beverly Hills, followed by a theatrical release in the United States by TriStar Pictures on December 25, 2017.

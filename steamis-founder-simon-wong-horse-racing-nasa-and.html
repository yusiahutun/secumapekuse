He started out as a riding boy and went on to [become] an assistant trainer.” But that was as far as his grandfather could go without having had an education, Wong explains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wong’s father, on the other hand, started his career as a riding boy (a bronco rider) at a time when only a handful of Chinese riders were capable of filling this position. After 50 years on the job – and through a combination of luck and talent – his father became a successful horse trainer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Coming from [this] background, I was trained to be a jockey by my grandfather and [the rest of] my family.” Wong was also trained by his uncle, who took care of wushu film horses, at ShawStudios from the age of seven.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/24/c87f8344-d02c-11e7-986f-48a2e310a482_972x_105536.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As fate would have it, Wong left Hong Kong for America with his family when he was 12 – effectively putting a stop to his dreams of becoming a jockey. “My connection with horses since I came back to Hong Kong is to ride as much and as often [as possible]. I started my training as a dressage rider a few years ago and hope to start my competition journey soon.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To Wong, timing is everything. The sequence of events in his life – his return to Hong Kong; meeting his wife Winnie Young Yuen-yee (a former Miss Hong Kong); having children; and going into the education business – has led him to where he is today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/11/24/fa350d10-d030-11e7-986f-48a2e310a482_972x_105536.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My wife spearheaded the project as she saw there was a need for change in our Hong Kong traditional learning system,” Wong says. Inspired by a sister-in-law who is an ESL specialist programme developer and trainer for the American Education board, and a cousin who used to work for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, an American federal research facility, the Wongs saw an opportunity to bring science-focused education to Hong Kong. Their efforts led to an exclusive partnership with the American space agency. Early evenings are a thing of the past now for Wong, due to the US-Hong Kong time difference.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Regardless of work commitments, Wong always puts his family first. He never misses dinner with his wife and children, and always puts the little ones to bed each night.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wong’s father described punctuality as a way of showing respect to the other party. “I try to uphold what my father taught me, but with the Hong Kong traffic situation, one can never tell … I just try to do my best and not to disappoint.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqmdn6W5pnnEr5ynrKNkrrPAyJyjnmdiZn9yfphyZqyslZa6qr%2BMn6auppSav26%2FyKamp2WnpLuoeceoqaydXaeupLXNoGSnmaOWeqK6ww%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsteamis-founder-simon-wong-horse-racing-nasa-and.html&text=STEAM%20school%20founder%20Simon%20Wong%20on%20horse%20racing%2c%20Nasa%2c%20and%20the%20importance%20of%20good%20timing&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsteamis-founder-simon-wong-horse-racing-nasa-and.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsteamis-founder-simon-wong-horse-racing-nasa-and.html&title=STEAM%20school%20founder%20Simon%20Wong%20on%20horse%20racing%2c%20Nasa%2c%20and%20the%20importance%20of%20good%20timing" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsteamis-founder-simon-wong-horse-racing-nasa-and.html&title=STEAM%20school%20founder%20Simon%20Wong%20on%20horse%20racing%2c%20Nasa%2c%20and%20the%20importance%20of%20good%20timing" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsteamis-founder-simon-wong-horse-racing-nasa-and.html&title=STEAM%20school%20founder%20Simon%20Wong%20on%20horse%20racing%2c%20Nasa%2c%20and%20the%20importance%20of%20good%20timing" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsteamis-founder-simon-wong-horse-racing-nasa-and.html&description=STEAM%20school%20founder%20Simon%20Wong%20on%20horse%20racing%2c%20Nasa%2c%20and%20the%20importance%20of%20good%20timing" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./450616-the-biggest-gangs-world-by-population.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The top 15 biggest gangs in the world by population">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sioux-city-teacher-charged-with-felony-assault-victim-hospitalized-from-injuries.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sioux City teacher charged with felony assault, victim hospitalized from injuries">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

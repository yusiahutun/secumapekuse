For three days, police searched for Jorelys. Brunn even joined the search one evening. Investigators found her in a trash bin at the apartment complex.</span><br></p><p><span>Jorelys family has sued the apartment complex managers, accusing them of failing to properly check Brunn's background. The lawsuit claims Brunn was retained despite residents' complaints about him lingering at the playground watching children. A manager at the apartment complex didn't immediately return a telephone call from The Associated Press.</span><br></p><p><span>Brunn was in custody for more than a month before he decided to plead guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

He made his debut at the 2021 Royal Rumble event and collaborated with fellow Puerto Rican wrestler Damian Priest in a tag team. But this time, he fought against his former teammate and brawled it out in a ‚Äústreet fight.‚Äù</p><p>So what happened to <a href=# id=auto-tag_bad-bunny data-tag=bad-bunny>Bad Bunny</a> and his epic fight with Damian Priest?

He made an entrance with a shopping cart full of chains, bats, folding chairs and sticks in this ‚Äústreet fighter‚Äù edition of the pay-per-view special. Bad Bunny was joined by the legendary Rey Mysterio and some members of the Latin World Order Finn Balor, Carlito and Dominik Mysterio. Damian sent Bad Bunny through a table below the technical area, resulting in some injuries that he highlighted in his Instagram stories after the match. He exposed his back to reveal some cuts and fresh bruises, in contrast to his Met Gala look a couple days prior where he had a clean back exposed in his outfit.</p><p>Bad Bunny winded up winning the match as he wielded his signature <a href=# id=auto-tag_wrestling data-tag=wrestling>wrestling</a> move ‚Äúthe Bunny Destroyer‚Äù against Damien. Fans went wild on social media‚Äîcalling it one of the best matches to date. One fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">tweeted,</a> ‚ÄúBack in 2021, Bad Bunny was professing his love for WWE and pro wrestling ü§ç I bet few people paid attention to his words before he made his wrestling debut & today he is The Greatest Celebrity Wrestler Of All Time.‚Äù</p><p>Another fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">reacted</a> saying that the spectacle should have been the main event. ‚ÄúHonestly it‚Äôs a HUGE L for WWE not letting Bad Bunny & Damian Priest main event the show. The two deserved that, and look at this. You have Rey Mysterio, LWO, Bad Bunny, Savio Vega, & freaking Carlito ALL in the same ring. That‚Äôs a visual to end the show on‚Ä¶.. #WWEBacklash‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bad-bunny-back.jpeg><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Allure,</a> Bad Bunny described his affection towards professional wrestling. ‚ÄúTruly, wrestling has influenced me a lot, and I‚Äôve applied that to my career,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe style, the importance of having a trademark move or phrase or look, and always remembering the element of surprise. In wrestling, the fans love getting caught off guard. I like to create that same emotion with my music.‚Äù He then talked about his WWE career and how he‚Äôs super proud of it. ‚ÄúIt was like I died and went to heaven,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never sat to watch a recording of one of my concerts. Never. But<a href=# data-uri=205d9eabd831613e597ccdf3105a82f3 rel=nofollow>&nbsp;my wrestling fight</a>&nbsp;‚Äî I‚Äôve watched it a hundred times. For like a week, I would go to bed watching it.‚Äù</p><p>Before the match, Damien Priest talked to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> and commended his former teammate and his devotion to the WWE. He actually trained him before the fight, too. ‚ÄúI saw the work he put in,‚Äù Damien said. ‚ÄúI saw how quickly he picked it up. I would explain things to him once and he‚Äôd be able to just do it. He showed up at WrestleMania.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúHe loves the business,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a big fan. And he‚Äôs treated it with respect. So, I know for him to come back now, he‚Äôs not here promoting anything and he wants to be involved in the product, so I would imagine he‚Äôs just as happy now as he was for his first match at WrestleMania. He was like a little kid, excited, and nervous, I remember that. It was awesome.‚Äù</p><p>On his own devotion to his craft and his homeland, Damien said, ‚ÄúI fell in love with wrestling in Puerto Rico. It‚Äôs like religion out there. I looked up to these superstars like they were superheroes and it‚Äôs wild to me that I get to bring that feeling to the island and maybe some kid sees me and thinks the same. That means the world to me.‚Äù</p><p>He also said that it‚Äôs a bigger honor to have the match in Puerto Rico than winning a championship. ‚ÄúIndividually, yeah, I could win the big title or I could have that ‚ÄòWrestleMania moment,‚Äô but this? This is so much more than just about me or him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is about our culture and our heritage and that cannot be duplicated, that feeling of being involved in something this important. It‚Äôs got to be the biggest thing I ever do.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/met-gala-bad-bunny.jpg><p>What else is going on with Bad Bunny? Well, he‚Äôs out in Hollywood and dating Kendall Jenner. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;that the fling might be turning into something more. ‚ÄúKendall and Bad Bunny are attracted to each other and definitely have a flirty vibe,‚Äù the source dished. ‚ÄúIt is still new, but they‚Äôre enjoying each other‚Äôs company and like each other. They have mutual friends and had dinner with Hailey, Justin and friends at Wally‚Äôs in Beverly Hills on Saturday night. It‚Äôs been fun for both of them so far.‚Äù The source continued, ‚ÄúBad Bunny recently bought a new home in Los Angeles and has spent a lot more time there.‚Äù The source adds that it‚Äôs all fun for the pair. ‚ÄúKendall met him through a mutual friend and they hit it off. As of now, it‚Äôs not serious and the two are having fun.‚Äù</p><p>After the Met Gala and on their way to the afterparties, Bad Bunny stood behind Kendall Jenner in most of the paparazzi photos and let her look have its moment. This is the second time<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner have been photographed out in New York City</a> together this week. The pair was spotted on Saturday, April 29, 2023 ahead of the Met Gala heading to dinner together at the popular Italian restaurant, Carbone, in the West Village.</p><p><i><span>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you‚Äôll love as much as we do.

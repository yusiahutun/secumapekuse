Together, the couple decided to wait to have sex until they tied the knot, which they say made them feel closer to God.</p><p>“He doesn’t ask us not to have sex for him because he wants rules and stuff. He’s like, I’m trying to protect you from hurt and pain. I think sex can cause a lot of pain. Sometimes people have sex because they don’t feel good enough. Because they lack self-worth. Women do that, and guys do that. I wanted to rededicate myself to God in that way because I really felt it was better for the condition of my soul. And I believe that God blessed me with Hailey as a result,” Justin told <a href=#>Vogue</a>.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Miranda Kerr</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Evan Spiegel</strong></a></p><p>Miranda Kerr and her Snapchat founder husband Evan Spiegel made the decision to wait to have sex until they were married because of Evan’s very traditional views. When asked about the possibility of having children before their wedding because she didn’t use birth control, Miranda explained that it wasn’t physically possible until they tied the knot.</p><p>“Not yet. Not until after we get married. My partner is very traditional. We can’t...I mean we’re just...waiting,” Miranda told <a href=#>The Times</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:50fefd77-3b08-42ef-9227-a1fd26a38156 data-container-ref=toofab:article:c53b5c91-fa01-4155-835e-f12310599436 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2a/5by4/2021/05/27/2a60c26a7e3648f48f155b139b6cd1f7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">These Famous Couples Reunited After A Major Breakup</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Adriana Lima</strong></a></p><p>Before Adriana Lima tied the knot with her first husband Marko Jarić, she revealed that she was saving herself for marriage because of her Catholic faith. She noted that she didn’t care what potential suitors had to say and that they would have to respect her decision.</p><p>“Sex is for after marriage,” Adriana told <a href=#>GQ</a>, adding, “They have to respect that this is my choice. If there’s no respect, that means they don’t want me.”</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Mariah Carey </strong></a><strong>& </strong><a href=#><strong>Nick Cannon</strong></a></p><p>Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon may have been in other serious relationships before they began dating, but the couple decided that they would wait to have sex until they got married. The duo abstained during their short courtship and tied the knot in April of 2008, just two months after meeting.</p><p>“It’s not that we had no intimacy, we just didn’t have complete intimacy. It’s just me, and my feelings. I definitely don’t want to push it on anybody else. But we both have similar beliefs, and I just thought that it would be so much more special if we waited until after we were married. And it was, and it still is,” Mariah told <a href=#>Mirror</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:36ebf7e1-0027-40be-9f0a-f0cfafd8386c data-container-ref=toofab:article:c53b5c91-fa01-4155-835e-f12310599436 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1c/5by4/2021/04/06/1c76660c6b144ccea7b60820717441b2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Former Celebrity Couples Who Successfully Co-Parent</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Ciara</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Russell Wilson</strong></a></p><p>Ciara and Russell Wilson were both married once prior to beginning their own relationship and decided that they would remain celibate until they walked down the aisle. Ciara explained that she wanted to spend time building a strong foundation for their relationship before they had sex.</p><p>"I really believe that when you focus on a friendship, you have the opportunity to build a strong foundation for a relationship - and once you know you're really great friends and you're what we call 'equally yoked,' where you share the same values or the same outlook on life, it kind of sets the tone. Knowing that you'll always have the friendship and that you can always go back to it is very important, and very powerful...You shouldn't feel like you have to give your body away to get someone to like you," Ciara told <a href=#>Cosmopolitan South Africa</a>.</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Jessica Simpson</strong></a></p><p>Jessica Simpson was very open about her decision to remain a virgin until she was married. She says that when she told her future husband Nick Lachey, she was worried that he would walk away from their relationship, but fortunately, he “stayed patient.” And although she says there were moments when she almost changed her mind, the duo kept their promise until they married in 2002.</p><p>“He paused, taking it all in.

As for the reasoning behind her choice, she explained she was waiting to find the right person.</p><p>"I don't know if you'd characterize me as uptight, but I understood what it is to be so afraid of sex—of your sexuality. For me it was just, 'No, I'm saving myself because I have to make myself worthy of the kind of man I have in mind,'" Lisa reportedly said.</p><p><strong>10. </strong><a href=#><strong>Tamera Mowry</strong></a></p><p>Tamera Mowry and her now-husband Adam Housley made the decision not to have sex before their wedding in 2011 due to their strong faith in God. She explained that it helped them know if they were truly meant to be together without clouded judgement.</p><p>“We said, ‘it’s got to be God’s way and not our way.’ We didn’t want to half-step anything. So our right way was the way we felt God wanted us to do it which was being celibate. We said to God, ‘This is who we are, I know you take us as we are, our faults, our fears, our joys, our hope as a couple and have your way.’ You just have to keep God the center of your relationship,” Tamera told <a href=#>Ebony</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e5d1eb68-5706-46ae-9fe9-9afd0d7a9c01 data-container-ref=toofab:article:c53b5c91-fa01-4155-835e-f12310599436 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d5/5by4/2021/06/28/d5eefc221409444da14fcd1c573d1c48_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">14 Celebs Who Graduated With Surprising College Degrees</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>11.</strong><a href=#><strong> Sean Lowe</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Catherine Giudici</strong></a></p><p>Sean Lowe, who met his future wife Catherine Giudici while he was the “Bachelor,” remained abstinent until the duo tied the knot.

The white supremacist gang member is already serving a 45-year sentence for a 2004 killing and is in lockdown for most of the day. In 2009 he made a bizarre bid to convince an Orange County jury that he deserves death by telling them he has killed two other people and never been caught. He also told the court that he's heard Death Row isn't so bad - especially when compared to his current living conditions. There he claimed an inmate could 'stretch your bones a little bit' with more recreation time than a maximum-security inmate.

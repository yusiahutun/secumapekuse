The spectacle is lovely but if you didn't care about the people then the spectacle would wear off pretty quickly. We had these huge, chaotic, high-octane first three episodes of the season so to<strong>&nbsp;bring things down and have a more intimate character-driven episode is going to be a really nice&nbsp;</strong><strong>breather&nbsp;</strong>and a way to honor these characters that we've spent seven seasons getting to know, and to really focus in on them – because they are the show."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9794db36e4cf-1714941710.jpg><p id=eUjxTCxvIpB data-wc=75>Despite the suggestion from many that is an ensemble show, Buck has always been, from the opening episode, the point of view character for audiences. It's therefore no surprise that the episode focuses so heavily on the character, or that the episode references his name ('Buck, Bothered and Bewildered', a rare moment where a character is named outside of the 'Begins' episodes,) and <strong>Oliver admits the episode will "further his character development a lot".&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eQPBeGEMOEa data-wc=80>A large part of this development will focus on Buck's new friendship with Tommy Kinard (Lou Ferrigno Jr) who was a former member of Firehouse 118, working alongside Hen Wilson (Aisha Hinds) and <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Howard 'Chimney' Han (Kenneth Choi</a>) before Buck joined the team. Tommy reappeared in episode three, working for LAFD's Air Operations and helping Buck, Chimney, Hen and <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Eddie Diaz (Ryan Guzman)&nbsp;</a>rescue Captain Bobby Nash (Peter Krause) and Sergeant Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) from their capsized cruise ship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1318ea9dbc90-1713110488.jpg><p id=eCy8idcIIA data-wc=28>His return will play out over at least several episodes, and Oliver teased how Tommy will bring out a side of Buck we haven't seen in a while.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQq8myS2um data-wc=57>"Tommy works at air support and Buck's going to be impressed, he's going to think that Tommy's really cool," shared Oliver. "The Tommy that Buck is going to meet is somebody that he's impressed by; Tommy has all these big toys, big helicopters that he flies around and Buck thinks that's really cool. That is classic Buck."&nbsp;</p><p id=eRUvi2mbp_ data-wc=80>But the friendship won't be easy: "<strong>It's gonna bring up some feelings of almost jealousy at first because Buck's going to lean into that friendship and then maybe that friendship is going to be taken away a little bit,&nbsp;</strong>and he's going to have to figure things out because his friends tend to always be people that he gets to see all day, every day at the 118 and obviously that's not how friendship in the real world always works.&nbsp;</p><p id=evSPISEgtz data-wc=52>"You just have to trust that somebody's your friend, even if you're not speaking to them day in and day out, and I think it's going to be really fun to see that play out, and for Buck to discover a new friendship that isn't in his immediate world every single day."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/47eb9d3ec76e-1715652128.jpg><p id=eTQVxdQ6vZ data-wc=66>In a Q&A with the Television Critics Association before the season premiere, Oliver teased that season seven would see his character going on a journey of self-discovery, and he told <strong>HELLO!</strong> this 100th episode will be the beginning of what he calls a "long-running [character arc]", and that this journey will not only impact Buck but his 118 family as well, and only for the better.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHb0cHYX3Ci data-wc=53>"More than anything, I think if [this development] is going to impact the 118 it will only be in a positive sense. <strong>Buck has real family to lean on in the 118 and he'll certainly be making use of that; it's a chance for them to all grow as a unit," he said.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eAv0jjW6r9 data-wc=49>"The bond that has been formed between the 118 is pretty ironclad and I don't think much could impact it, certainly not negatively at this point, and in episode five and episode six, we'll certainly see him making use of that support system, and learning more about those relationships."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4312a248da4b-171277compr3.jpg><p id=ekrUnBhoog data-wc=37>season seven is a shortened 10 episode season due to the 2023 strikes, and ABC has renewed the series for an eighth season which is expected to return to screens in September for a normal-length season.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezZcRo4kTgF data-wc=35>The rest of the season will also see Chimney and Buck's sister Maddie Buckley <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>(Jennifer Love Hewitt)</a> get married, which will mean the return of the Buckley parents, with whom Buck has a strained relationship.&nbsp;</p><p id=eDCv5rr5y0 data-wc=13>Don't expect too much drama between the Buckley parents and their youngest though.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Station 19's Jaina Lee Ortiz on happy ever afters and season 7's cancelation " class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5c5cebe8f311-jaina-lee-ortiz-spotlight-banner.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Station 19's Jaina Lee Ortiz on happy ever afters and season 7's cancelation " class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Station 19's Jaina Lee Ortiz on happy ever afters and season 7's cancelation</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e5o7VNzz6R data-wc=57>"It's nice that we have, to a large degree, moved past the trauma of their early years together, and I think it's good to show that there's often room for healing in relationships, that because there have been some trying times between them that doesn't mean that they can never recover and rebuild a relationship," Oliver mused.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCwxsfZQgS data-wc=46>"It will be nice to have them around for Buck, and they're certainly going to be in a loving mood because it's a wedding and weddings tend to bring out the best in people and there will certainly be some nice moments for the Buckley family."&nbsp;</p><p id=ekVLegRz-D data-wc=20>The cast are, however, still filming the final few episodes of the season, and anything can change on network TV.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3JN6Sf7uv data-wc=64>But Oliver is certain about one thing: "<strong>Buck's journey of self-discovery will, for sure, be a long-running [character arc] but I think I just want to see Buck settled, and proud, of his decisions,&nbsp;</strong>and to be able to walk tall and not feel like he needs to hide any part of himself and just be open to being the Buck that makes him."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

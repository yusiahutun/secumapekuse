Is this something you’re feeling intuitively guided towards? Although the sun’s journey through analytical Virgo tends to bring greater emphasis to practical matters and day-to-day affairs, it’s important to consider <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>how the full blue moon in Pisces of August 2023 will affect each zodiac sign</a>.</p><p>Full moons are equivalent to a call for balance between your emotional and physical reality, so it’s important to be mindful of what the moon is illuminating for you at this time. For reference on this full-circle moment, think back to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the new moon in Pisces</a> that took place on February 20. What have you been consciously and/or unconsciously manifesting since?</p><p>This year’s full moon will adorn the night sky via 7 degrees of Pisces, on August 30 at exactly 9:35 p.m. ET. Before discussing the astrology of this lunation, however, it’s important to note that this is the second full moon happening in the month of August. The second full moon in a calendar month is referred to as a blue moon, which is where the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“once in a blue moon”</a> phrase is more than often used to describe the rarity of a situation. The blue-moon theme kinda goes well with Pisces’ water element, but I digress. As you may remember, the full moon phase occurs when the sun sits directly opposite the moon, activating the Virgo-Pisces axis in this particular case, which can be referred to as the astrological axis of heaven (Pisces) and earth (Virgo).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fullmooninlibra.gif?w=650"><p>While Neptune-ruled Pisces serves as a symbol of your dreams, intuition and subconscious, Mercury-ruled Virgo represents everything from one’s daily due diligence to their mental, and physical well being. If Pisces is elusive and highly receptive, Virgo steps in to simplify things and make a practical plan. With that said, amidst the sun’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">journey through responsible Virgo,</a> we are collectively prone to prioritizing logistics and mundane affairs over our soul’s calling, and connection to spirit. Nevertheless, leave it to a full moon in Pisces to shed light on subliminal feelings, both within and around us. Although, despite this mutable water sign’s mystical essence… it, too, has a dark side.&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The full blue moon in Pisces takes place on August 30 at 9:35 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Similar <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to Neptune</a>—its modern planetary ruler—Pisces can represent deception, delusion, and escapism. So, if this lunation isn’t illuminating an emotion you’ve been unconsciously repressing, it could potentially spotlight the areas of life where you’ve been deceiving yourself, or perhaps lacked firm boundaries. Fortunately, with the sun in Virgo balancing things out, there is an opportunity to ground your intuition, and finally confront what you’ve been sweeping under the rug. This goes hand-in-hand with the full moon’s conjunction <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>with taskmaster Saturn</a>, as it is specifically bringing attention to what needs to be managed, regulated and/or addressed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/saturninpisces.png><p>On another note, similar to the way Pisces concludes the sun’s journey through the zodiac, there could be something your higher self is asking you to surrender at this time. After all, Saturn last activated this degree of Pisces in April of this year, so it’s important to pay attention to what you’re being called to do, specifically when in regards to your spiritual sense of authority. If there is a heaviness attached to this situation, don’t let it discourage you. These are just growing pains.</p><p>If your&nbsp;<a href=#>sun sign</a>, <a href=#>moon sign</a> or <a href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following zodiac signs, the upcoming full moon will be intuitive and illuminating. Here’s why:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.2618403247632><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Exhausted? There’s never been a better time to rest, retreat and recharge your energy, Aries. This is especially true with the full moon in Pisces, touching down on your sleepy 12th house of closure, dreams, coping mechanisms, and unconscious patterns. The moon will be sitting alongside taskmaster Saturn, which adds a layer of pragmatism and responsibility to this mix, especially while in opposition to the sun in Virgo, via your sixth house of health, due diligence, and acts of service. When was the last time you took a day off? Consider this an opportunity for you to kick back, and check in with yourself behind the scenes. Take care of you. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3921568627451><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>Do you feel genuinely supported by your associates and peers, Taurus? You’re likely giving your sense of belonging in the world more thought than usual under this full blue moon in Pisces, but there’s more. While sitting alongside serious Saturn—via your 11th house of hopes and future visions—you are being called to responsibly commit to your mission on the planet. There’s also a desire for interconnectedness, and with the sun glimmering through Virgo and your fifth house of authenticity, this lunation could simultaneously bring awareness to themes surrounding your talents, skills, and unique abilities. How can you cultivate these gifts for the greater good? <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7496740547588><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>It’s time to take a stand, Gemini. The full moon is bringing emotional emphasis to your bossy 10th house of authority, reputation, career moves, and reputation in the world. For reference, think back to the new moon in Pisces that took place back in February, and pat yourself on the back, because you’ve come so far. Nevertheless, while sitting alongside Saturn, you could feel obligated to complete an important task, if not set boundaries with a parental figure or superior in the workplace. More importantly, however, a dream you manifested could be coming to fruition in this area of your life… but you know what they say, “heavy is the head who wears the crown.” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.8009950248756><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>Change is the only thing that’s constant, and the same goes for your belief systems, Cancer. This is significant to consider as the full moon ignites your sister-sign, Pisces, via your expansive ninth house of personal philosophies, higher learning, and unknown territory. A part of you could feel compelled to venture into the unknown and explore other horizons, and yet with the sun energizing your curious third house of immediate surroundings, your feelings could seem contradicting. Luna will be sitting alongside serious Saturn, adding a layer of grounding and maturity to the mix, but there’s no need to overthink. The real question is: do you have faith in yourself, and in the future you’re creating? <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lifestyle/zodiac/1630029/cancer-horoscope-september-2023/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8361075544174><h2>Leo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Leo.png><p>With the moon reaching its peak of fullness in Pisces—via your eighth house of mergers, intimate unions, and shared resources—you’re likely taking a closer look at your investments, and deciding whether they’re in alignment with your soul’s truth. Be it personally or professionally, you can no longer deny the areas of life that lack an equal amount of give and take, thanks to the moon’s close proximity to taskmaster Saturn. But if you’re feeling restricted or blocked in terms of your finances, be sure to lean on your planetary ruler, the sun, as it continues to energize your second house of money, stability and values while in Virgo. Communication leads to problem solving. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8714859437751><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Virgo.png><p>Have you been compromising your peace of mind for the sake of a relationship, Virgo? With the full moon in Pisces touching down on your committed seventh house of agreements, compromise and significant others—not to mention while sitting alongside serious Saturn, also known as Father Time—you are likely gaining clarity on the foundation of a partnership, if not re-evaluating your commitment entirely. This could be personally or professionally, but the good news is, the sun in your sign is energizing and revitalizing you in the process. If you’ve been feeling inhibited or restricted in a connection, this an opportunity to redefine your approach.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3618988902589><h2>Libra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Libra.png><p>It’s time to tend to your mental, physical and spiritual well being, Libra. The full blue moon in Pisces will ignite your responsible sixth house of health, due diligence, acts of service and day-to-day affairs, and all while making a conjunction with pragmatic Saturn. Do you need to shift your focus towards something more productive? Or have you been overworking yourself, and neglecting your health? With the sun energizing your 12th house of rest and surrender, chances are this lunation is bringing awareness to everything from your coping mechanisms to your unconscious behavioral patterns. Something’s gotta give, so reflect on how you can bring both of these parts of your life into alignment with one another. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.2810945273632><h2>Scorpio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Scorpio.png><p>Getting your creative mojo back, Scorpio? This is no secret with the full moon in Pisces activating your expressive fifth house of love, musings, and passion projects… but, there’s also a catch. The moon will be sitting together with serious Saturn which, in turn, adds a layer of maturity and restriction to the mix, whether personally or professionally speaking. However, instead of approaching this full-circle moment from an inhibited perspective, reflect on ways you can improve, and stabilize your creative vision moving forward. After all, with the sun glimmering through Virgo via your 11th house of community, you have both the support of your peers and the sense of direction to get the ball rolling. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.369918699187><h2>Sagittarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sagittarius.png><p>If you’re suddenly more nostalgic than usual, it’s not a coincidence, Sagittarius. With the moon reaching its peak of fullness in Pisces—via your fourth house of home, family matters, and emotional foundations—you are more prone to being in your feelings during this time. This is especially true with Saturn (Father Time) sitting together with the full moon, as it will likely shed light on something you’ve been consciously and/or unconsciously repressing (if not experiencing feelings of restriction), perhaps since February. Themes of home, family and your emotional support system are under the spotlight of the moon, but the sun continues to energize your career sector in the process.

This, of course, is something you know firsthand being a cardinal earth sign, but there will be a full moon in Pisces touching down on your curious third house of communication, neighbors, and immediate surroundings, and all while sitting alongside your celestial ruler, Saturn. Whether personally or professionally, you could be challenged to make an important decision… and well, the truth isn’t always easy to accept, let alone relay via message. Fortunately, with the sun in Virgo, you have a practical vision in place which is something you can ultimately depend on moving forward. In the meantime, reflect on the boundaries you need to put in place. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.2970011534025><h2>Aquarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aquarius.png><p>Your perception of stability is under the spotlight of this lunation, Aquarius. For instance, the full-blue moon will touch down on your second house of comfort, finances, and value systems, and all while sitting together with taskmaster Saturn in Pisces. This could feel like a reality check of sorts, at least when in regards to the foundation of your security. Be it personally or professionally, Saturn wants you to shift your approach, and commit to a solid plan of action. Fortunately, with the sun energizing your eighth house of mergers, you have the resources and/or necessary details surrounding a particular investment for the future. In any event, while holding space for your personal commitments, reflect on what you can improve for your own good moving forward. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.7989949748744><h2>Pisces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Pisces.png><p>Happy full moon, Pisces! You are more likely to be in your feelings at this time, considering how deep and personal it is for the moon to peak in your sign. However, while in a conjunction with Saturn, there is a layer of strength, maturity, and pragmatism surrounding this full-circle moment for you, so chances are you’re either in the process of stepping up your game, or feeling obliged to hold yourself accountable at this time. For reference, reflect on your personal progress since February. What have you accomplished since then? Despite whether this involves a significant other, you’re being intuitively guided to surrender your inhibitions, and approach your goals and dreams with confidence. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope</a>.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfnby4ecWuo6VlnaS8r3nPoqqcnaNirraz1KyrZpmWm7KkwIyemJygXa%2B8pbXAnGSsoZejenN8kWxm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-full-moon-pisces-august-affect-each-zodiac-sign-2023.html&text=Full%20Blue%20Moon%20in%20Pisces%20Will%20Affect%20Each%20Zodiac%20Sign%202023&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-full-moon-pisces-august-affect-each-zodiac-sign-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-full-moon-pisces-august-affect-each-zodiac-sign-2023.html&title=Full%20Blue%20Moon%20in%20Pisces%20Will%20Affect%20Each%20Zodiac%20Sign%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-full-moon-pisces-august-affect-each-zodiac-sign-2023.html&title=Full%20Blue%20Moon%20in%20Pisces%20Will%20Affect%20Each%20Zodiac%20Sign%202023" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-full-moon-pisces-august-affect-each-zodiac-sign-2023.html&title=Full%20Blue%20Moon%20in%20Pisces%20Will%20Affect%20Each%20Zodiac%20Sign%202023" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-full-moon-pisces-august-affect-each-zodiac-sign-2023.html&description=Full%20Blue%20Moon%20in%20Pisces%20Will%20Affect%20Each%20Zodiac%20Sign%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./model-and-actor-anthony-sandstrom-reveals-his-favourite.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Model and actor Anthony Sandstrom reveals his favourite cuisines">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elsie-fisher-texas-chainsaw-massacre-leatherface-spoilers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elsie Fisher Spills on Shocking Ending">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

I feel lucky to be writing this. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey. I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been endlessly inspired by so many in the trans community. Thank you for your courage, your generosity and ceaselessly working to make this world a more inclusive and compassionate place. I will offer whatever support I can and continue to strive for a more loving and equal society.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I also ask for patience. My joy is real, but it is also fragile. The truth is, despite feeling profoundly happy right now and knowing how much privilege I carry, I am also scared. I'm scared of the invasiveness, the hate, the 'jokes' and of violence. To be clear, I am not trying to dampen a moment that is joyous and one that I celebrate, but I want to address the full picture. The statistics are staggering. The discrimination towards trans people is rife, insidious and cruel, resulting in horrific consequences. In 2020 alone it has been reported that at least 40 transgender people have been murdered, the majority of which were Black and Latinx trans women. To the political leaders who work to criminalize trans health care and deny our right to exist and to all of those with a massive platform who continue to spew hostility towards the trans community: you have blood on your hands. You unleash a fury of vile and demeaning rage that lands on the shoulders of the trans community, a community in which 40% of trans adults report attempting suicide. Enough is enough. You aren't being 'cancelled', you are hurting people. I am one of those people and we won't be silent in the face of your attacks.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer. And the more I hold myself close and fully embrace who I am, the more I dream, the more my heart grows and the more I thrive. To all trans people who deal with harassment, self-loathing, abuse and the threat of violence every day: I see you, I love you and I will do everything to change this world for the better.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Thank you for reading this.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All my love,&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Elliot&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Three years later, in November 2017, Elliot accused X-Men director Brett Ratner of outing him as gay on set, when the actor was just 18.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Juno actor made the allegations in a lengthy Facebook post, in which he also revealed that he had been fondled by a director and was sexually assaulted by a crew member when he was 16.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Elliot, Ratner outed him during a cast and crew meet-and-greet for X-Men: The Last Stand, where he urged a woman to have sex with the actor.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He looked at a woman standing next to me, ten years my senior, pointed to me and said: "You should f*** her to make her realize she's gay,"' Elliot claimed.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was a young adult who had not yet come out to myself.

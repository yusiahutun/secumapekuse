Don’t worry, because you have much to look forward to, especially when you realize <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1650155>how Mars in Scorpio will affect each zodiac sign</a>. if you’ve been waiting for a cosmic kick in the butt, then look no further since Mars in Scorpio 2023 will surely heighten your motivation.&nbsp;</p><p>You can blame the stars for any discouragement and recent blockages, given that the recent cosmic energy has been slower than usual. Between having low energy and very little drive, it might have been challenging to get out of bed in the morning. Luckily, this is about to change for the better <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when Mars enters Scorpio</a> on October 12.</p><p>In astrology, Mars is the minor malefic planet. As a minor malefic, Mars can be a perplexing energy to work with since this planet governs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rage, sex, and motivation</a>. Although this might be initially challenging to embody, Mars can eventually help us tap into our life force. When we look toward astrological transits, Mars could be the planetary reinforcer to help us become more comfortable with our sensual desires, express anger, and pursue goals.</p><p>You may feel like you’ve been brought back to life when Mars enters Scorpio at 12:04 a.m. ET on Thursday, October 12. From the get-go, this transit will be notably strong since Mars is domicile in Scorpio. In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>traditional astrology</a>, a domicile planet occurs when the celestial body is “at home” in the zodiac sign that it rules. Domicile planets are effortlessly expressive, invigorating a cosmic ease that everyone can benefit from. Given that Mars in Scorpio is domicile, we may feel renewed thanks to this newfound surge of energy. Thankfully, we can capitalize on this powerful transit until November 24.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-16.png><p>Seduction will be what Mars in Scorpio arguably does best. After waffling between sexual desires and decisions throughout Mars in Libra, we may feel more exact with what we want during Mars in Scorpio. Libido will be intensified, so any hesitancy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">surrounding sexual pursuits</a> and desires could be extinguished. Sexcapades are inevitable during this sensual Martian transit, so don’t be surprised if you and your lover are pushing the boundaries!</p><p>Second to sex, warfare is another shining attribute of Mars in Scorpio. This won’t be the transit to beat around the bush or to withhold your frustration. If anything, Mars in Scorpio will help pinpoint stressors, grievances, and more. Expressing and exploring your anger could be psychologically transformative since this Mars in Scorpio can help you get comfortable with the uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Mars in Scorpio can assist with taking action toward goals and endeavors. Determination will be strengthened since Mars in Scorpio knows what it wants and won’t be afraid to go after it. So, if you’ve been waiting for the right time to strike, then consider this transit the perfect time to pursue your objectives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-15.png><p>If you want to make the most of Mars in Scorpio, then you should keep an eye on a few upcoming astrological events.&nbsp;</p><p>The first major astrological event will be on Saturday, October 28 when Mars in Scorpio opposes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jupiter retrograde in Taurus</a>. The opposition will be our cosmic cue to look before we leap since pausing for the cause can help us determine the best course of action. By the following day, terse conversations could arise since Mars in Scorpio will conjunct Mercury in Scorpio. However, this conjunction could also lead to intense yet illuminating discussions.&nbsp;</p><p>Later on, there might be a unique twist of events when Mars in Scorpio opposes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Uranus retrograde in Taurus</a> on November 11. An opportunity, goal, or exchange may not go according to plan, so expect the unexpected during this opposition.&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>Mars enters Scorpio on October 12 and leaves it behind on November 24.</p></figure><p>Motivation to do something about your circumstances will be hard to ignore once the sun in Scorpio conjuncts Mars in Scorpio on November 18. The conjunction will fuel courage and bravery, so your willpower will be amplified. As a result, this could lead to heroic measures to improve your situation or reach a goal. However, this could also lead to ego clashes, so be careful about fueling unnecessary fires.</p><p>Lastly, there might be a final push when Mars in Scorpio forms a sextile <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Pluto in Capricorn</a> on November 21. Whenever tiny but mighty Pluto is involved, a delicate balance could become easily overpowered. The sextile will remind us of our strength and dexterity while encouraging us to use this tremendous surge of energy for good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-mars-in-scorpio-2023-will-affect-each-zodiac-sign>How Mars in Scorpio 2023 Will Affect Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from Mars in Scorpio, according to your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun sign</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3881499395405><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Honor your innate power, Aries.

Things are getting down to the wire, so we get it.</p><p>Plus, this is always the time that someone gets a second One-on-One date before someone else has even had a first one. Well, how about doubling your trouble because Charity did that twice in a row this week.</p><p>Of the six guys, four had enjoyed One-on-Ones with her and there were two One-on-Ones this week. Seems logical she'd pick the two she'd not yet had that intimate time to get to know better, right? Well, logic goes out the window when the heart's involved, apparently.</p><p>As Sean and Tanner looked on (and on and on), Charity asked first Joey and then Dotun to go on One-on-Ones this week. And yes, you read that right, that means Dotun is getting a One-on-One two weeks in a row. That's like getting slapped in the face two times in a row if you've not had one at all!</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:70ecb536-d605-4d0e-99c6-439583f8de43 data-container-ref=toofab:article:babf39df-a512-4d42-9548-d4f195adf53a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c5/5by4/2023/07/12/c5bb6ee03d9d4d83bd07cb4f61df3735_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Hulu</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kim Kardashian Shocks Family By Saying She's Doing The Bachelorette</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Sean was getting all kinds of fired up about it because he was seeing a strength in his connection with Charity that she wasn't seeing and we certainly weren't seeing from home. Maybe the scarves were reminding her of Brayden, even if his are cashmere.</p><p>To add insult to insult, Charity instead invited the One-on-One-less twins on a dreaded Two-on-One. If Group Dates are awkward, this format is tortuous. They went on a Bayou gator tour as the gang was in New Orleans this week, and neither of them were all that compelling.</p><p>This franchise has never been subtle with their edits and both Sean and Tanner were getting the bland factory settings edit this week, for sure. It was amusing because they were almost identically forgettable when with Charity, and then Sean was so much more fired up in his confessionals.</p><p>By the end of their Two-on-One they had convinced Charity of absolutely nothing. It's kind of like watching paint dry, it takes forever and it seems like nothing is happening the whole time. That's how the date felt for us, too. So she didn't had out a Rose at all, and was magnanimous enough to not cut them both right then.</p><p>Well, that might have been producers reminding her they still have to edit all of this into a two-hour show. So let's at least drag this out a bit. By this point, we were thinking it would take a miracle to save either one of them.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0d6591c9-f755-4a4a-8e8d-7c94332ab341 data-container-ref=toofab:article:babf39df-a512-4d42-9548-d4f195adf53a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/04/5by4/2023/07/24/048a382146764d0b923dc8451b8339db_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sharna Burgess Slams Trolls Criticizing Son's Long Hair and Pink Scrunchie</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Charity has had meaningful connections with Xavier and Aaron before this week and some really cute moments. Tanner is so forgettable we legitimately forget he's part of this cast every single week (sorry, Tanner!). Sean was building this all up so much in his mind the fall was nigh inevitable.</p><p>That said, we didn't see how it would come, even as we were feeling very confident that it would.</p><p>There wasn't any drama in the One-on-One dates Charity did go on. She and Joey had a fun, easy day in New Orleans that culminated in a meaningful conversation about the fact they would be an interracial couple. Joey was thoughtful and realistic in his responses, which really sat well with Charity.</p><p>it's worth noting she did not have this conversation with either Tanner and Sean. It could be because their collective blandness was causing her to temporarily black out throughout their date -- or because she wasn't yet at that place emotionally with them to really explore such a real issue.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d890538d-edfe-4dc0-8f07-6f841e2c6dc6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:babf39df-a512-4d42-9548-d4f195adf53a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/30/5by4/2023/07/24/3004cb28338048afab874cd682192c80_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tiffany Haddish Says Common Breakup 'Wasn't Mutual'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She and Dotun did a half-marathon fun run through the streets of the city and it was another very sweet and easy date. Of these final six guys, she seems to be the most fully relaxed with Dotun and Joey, with Aaron a close third. Things are just always a little more serious with Aaron, it seems.</p><p>The week played out that way, as well. Both Joey and Dotun had tame, simple, fun dates that ended with them getting Roses on their chests. After the failed Two-on-One, she scheduled a Group Date with all four of her Rose-less men, but only three would wind up going.</p><p>Sean decided he couldn't handle the lack of validation, and so he went to her hotel room to tell her how confident he was in them still despite the lack of validation (which he defines as a Rose on your chest prior to the Rose Ceremony). Honestly, we're not sure what he thought was going to happen. Was she going to pin a Rose on him in her room?</p><p>Ultimately, as he went on and on about their connection, it became more and more clear that this was a one-way street and Charity was not at all on the same page he was as to how things were going between them. Finally, she couldn't take it anymore and just walked him out.</p><p>Had he stayed out of her room, he'd have gone on that Group Date and might have had a shot of staying. That's because Xavier got pretty real with Charity, too, in telling her that he wasn't sure he could see himself devoting himself entirely to just one person forever and ever -- you know, the end goal of this whole show.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b180ebcd-7245-4c15-8c32-d524a9f54a17 data-container-ref=toofab:article:babf39df-a512-4d42-9548-d4f195adf53a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2023/07/25/7fa7f80dd4e047b8b1b52f019d7b171a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Doja Cat Loses Nearly 200,000 Followers After Going to War with Fans Over Kittenz Nickname</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>He did sort of finally clarify that he felt he could get there with her and even looked forward to it. His intention was to be honest with her, but as he admitted in a confessional, that's blown up on him before. The problem is that she probably also forgot Tanner was still around.</p><p>We're kidding, of course. She remembered Tanner enough to know that there was no real future there. Still, despite there being two Roses at the Rose Ceremony, she only gave one of them out ... and it, of course, went to Aaron. Aside from having her back about Brayden week after week, they have shared a very real and strong connection. Their conversations flow easier, too, despite how long it's been since their One-on-One (the first of the season).</p><p>And so, when she revealed she wasn't going to hand out the final Rose of the week at the Group Date, she left Tanner (for the second time this week) staring at a Rose not handed out because she can't decide. She couldn't decide between him and Sean at the Two-on-One and now couldn't decide between him and Xaver at the Group Date. What's the common denominator?</p><p>Charity finally figured out that if she keeps not being able to commit to Tanner, it might be a pretty clear message that this is not the dude for you. And so, she sent him home and then spooked Xavier into thinking maybe he wouldn't get it, either, before finally pinning it on him.</p><p>And so, Aaron B, Dotun, Joey, and Xavier will introduce Charity to their families next week. All things being equal, we'd say Xavier was in the most trouble, but then we see teasers about Joey maybe not being authentic and guys not being ready and it could be total chaos.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9db50df8-aeb2-4de8-a934-1da5d457719b data-container-ref=toofab:article:babf39df-a512-4d42-9548-d4f195adf53a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/eb/5by4/2023/07/25/eb54b2384b6d4558820a4cda4e8bbc26_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Shanna Moakler Revisits Oscar De La Hoya Affairs, Rape Allegations, Dumping Her for Career</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h3 class=h3>"Mansion" Chatter</h3><ul><li>"I want to know how you feel about being in an interracial relationship and I want to elaborate on why that's so important to me." --Charity (to Joey)</li><li>"Please do." --Joey</li><li>"Just my past relationship and kind of diving into that, it was a relationship that didn't start off very great but I think it was almost inevitable that when we would go out, like, it's just the things that you face and it's unfortunate but that's just the times that we still live in.

I can go on and on all night truly about everything that you are. As of right now with what this is and where I'm at, what you want from me I can't give and I'm very fearful of not being able to get there.

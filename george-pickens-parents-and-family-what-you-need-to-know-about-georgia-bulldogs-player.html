He is a true believer in his sport and plays it with passion and respect. Carl Pickens is also rumored to be one of his parents.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Based on George’s performance, it can be undoubtedly said that George is one of the most brilliant wide receivers to come out of the football team Georgia. He was born on March 4, 2001, in America, in the city of Hoover located in Alabama. He is also known as George M. Pickens, which is also his full name.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Pickens</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>finished his higher studies at Hoover High School, located in his birthplace Alabama. He is a hard worker and had 69 receptions for 1368 yards and 16 touchdowns as a senior. He took part in 2019 Under Armour All-American Game.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>George by ethnicity is an African-American. However, he was born in Hoover, Alabama, USA and he grew up there. So, he holds American citizenship. Other than that, more details about his grandparents and his family background are not available in the news or other sources.</span></p><h2 id=who-are-george-pickenss-parents><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-george-pickenss-parents></span>Who Are George Pickens’s Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>George Pickens’s parents’ detailed information has not been divulged yet. But it has been rumored that his father’s name is Carl Pickens, who also played as a wide receiver in the National Football League for many years. On the other hand, George’s mother’s name is still unknown. George has never been found talking about his parents on public platforms.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Because he has kept much of his personal life concealed from the public or limelight, it’s difficult to learn more about the player’s parents. Similarly, Geroge’s parents are not mentioned in any of his social media posts. So, it becomes hard to know about them precisely.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We can only presume that his parents were supportive of him and helped him choose a professional path in such a predicament. That being said, the precise information regarding his parents is still unknown to many people.</span></p><h2 id=who-are-george-pickenss-siblings><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-george-pickenss-siblings></span>Who Are George Pickens’s Siblings?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>George Pickens is also recognized as the younger brother of Chris Humes, a former star at Spain Park and Arkansas State.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true></span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>@FootballUGA hey the bio for George Pickens is worded weird. George is the younger brother but his bio says Chris Humes is the younger brother that player in college previously.</p><p>— DevyLeagueFootball (@DevyLeague) July 24, 2019</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>George’s younger brother Chris is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s defensive backfield (NCAA). He was born on July 31, 1994, in Birmingham, Alabama, and is 27 years old now. Other than that George is also the nephew of Auburn legend Bo Jackson.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Also, any further details about his other siblings and his relatives are still not known to people.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=what-is-george-pickenss-net-worthnbsp><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-george-pickenss-net-worth></span>What Is George Pickens’s Net Worth?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>George Pickens’s net worth is estimated to be around $5 million. George made the majority of his money through his Yeezy footwear. Although he had overstated the scale of his business over the years, the money he made from it was enough to qualify him as one of the largest celeb cashouts of all time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His primary source of wealth is his accomplishment as an American football player. His net worth comprises his assets, properties & the bank balance he has maintained as one of the most successful athletes.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BVpL%2BosYypoJyjlaPAbrzAq5ynrKNirq%2BwjJ%2BYpqGcrnq4tMCtZLKnpWK7prHDZquoZZujvLh5wJumrqxdnLKwvsaimGaapaG5pbvGrGSppJGusrN4i2VjZWRc</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-pickens-parents-and-family-what-you-need-to-know-about-georgia-bulldogs-player.html&text=George%20Pickens%20Parents%20And%20Family%3f%20What%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20Georgia%20Bulldogs%20Player&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-pickens-parents-and-family-what-you-need-to-know-about-georgia-bulldogs-player.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-pickens-parents-and-family-what-you-need-to-know-about-georgia-bulldogs-player.html&title=George%20Pickens%20Parents%20And%20Family%3f%20What%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20Georgia%20Bulldogs%20Player" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeorge-pickens-parents-and-family-what-you-need-to-know-about-georgia-bulldogs-player.html&title=George%20Pickens%20Parents%20And%20Family%3f%20What%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20Georgia%20Bulldogs%20Player" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-pickens-parents-and-family-what-you-need-to-know-about-georgia-bulldogs-player.html&title=George%20Pickens%20Parents%20And%20Family%3f%20What%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20Georgia%20Bulldogs%20Player" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-pickens-parents-and-family-what-you-need-to-know-about-georgia-bulldogs-player.html&description=George%20Pickens%20Parents%20And%20Family%3f%20What%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20Georgia%20Bulldogs%20Player" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./remove-silent-bell-icon-iphone-15-pro.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Remove the Silent Bell Icon on the iPhone 15 Pro">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ali-harnell-heads-new-tmgaeg-nashville-office.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ali Harnell Heads New TMG/AEG Nashville Office">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

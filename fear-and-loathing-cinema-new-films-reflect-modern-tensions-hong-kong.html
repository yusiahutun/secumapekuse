The films deliberately accentuate their "Hongkongness", often making use of colloquialisms, amid growing mainland influence on the city and rising cross-border antagonism.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some of the films are Hong Kong-mainland co-productions partly funded by a mainland financier.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Opening this month, , the directorial debut of columnist Chip Tsao, touches on sensitive events such as the annual June 4 protests over the Tiananmen crackdown. Raunchy comedy stars politically vocal comedian Chapman To Man-chat as a lowly writer of soft-porn stories for a newspaper in Hong Kong who ventures into the Japanese adult video industry. It features enough nudity to ensure it would not make it to mainland cinema screens, and makes much of the "Hong Kong spirit" of hard work and determination.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">May and June will see two joint Hong Kong-mainland productions telling localist stories. Pang Ho-cheung's opens in May after premiering at the Hong Kong International Film Festival in March. While has been marketed as a family drama, Pang says the film portrays the pressures facing Hongkongers. In one scene, a young girl asks her uncle what the meaning of life is. The uncle instructs her: "Breathe in, hold your breath, and breathe out."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The film's Chinese title in Hong Kong reads or . On the mainland, the film has a different title that literally translates as .</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It will be followed by crime thriller in June. The third instalment of the series directed by Felix Chong Man-keung, it centres on a property conspiracy involving the rights of indigenous inhabitants in the New Territories to build houses.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The movies are a warning to society, says Pierre Lam, critic and lecturer at Baptist University's College of International Education. The latest wave of cinematic localism shows criticism of the city's status quo has gone mainstream. "The city has reached a critical point," Lam says. "People are worried that the Hong Kong identity, the way the city functions and its core values will one day be forgotten."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is not the first time that parochialism and politics have spilled over into mainstream Hong Kong cinema, Lam says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the city was agonising over its future before the 1984 signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Ann Hui On-wah's reflected people's anxiety through a story of Vietnamese refugees fleeing the horrors of communism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan, who made the highly political "1997" trilogy - (1996), (1998) and (1999) - says Hong Kong residents were traditionally apathetic about politics. In the 1980s, a handover to China in 1997 seemed a remote prospect. But after the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989, native Hongkongers were scared and some who could afford it fled, Chan says.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">People are culturally battling against mainland suppressionKacey Wong, artist</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the 1990s, satirical comedies offered a catharsis for people's fears and uncertainties about the 1997 transition, says Lam. Alfred Cheung Kin-ting's (1990) made light of this fear of the unknown through the story of a local policeman's clashes with a patriotic mainland policewoman visiting to solve a crime. The so-called expiry date of Hong Kong - July 1, 1997 - was a recurring theme in many films of the time, including Wong Kar-wai's acclaimed (1994).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This latest wave of politically conscious cinema began in 2012, says Lam. "Coincidentally, it was the year when Leung Chun-ying won the chief executive election."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a scene from Chan's contribution to the 2013 portmanteau horror , a triad boss with a name pronounced Leung Chun-ying - but written in different Chinese characters - seeks help to eradicate his enemy by going to Tin Lok Lane and paying a woman to smack down his bad luck with her slippers under the Wan Chai overpass. For the character of a middle-aged loser who repeatedly tries to lead the group in , the director says he drew inspiration from Leung.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Movies with a strong Hong Kong flavour did best at the local box office in 2012. , which took in HK$42.8 million, was a crime thriller about Hong Kong's security forces. The foul-mouthed comedy , starring Chapman To as a failed filmmaker, charts some of the intense Hong Kong-mainland conflicts; it made HK$30 million. Hong Kong stories with liberal doses of course Cantonese slang had suddenly became box-office gold.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Lam, Hong Kong people feel helpless about cross-border conflicts, political reform and universal suffrage, believing the decisions lie in Beijing's hands.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"People are pessimistic about the future of Hong Kong. And there's nothing they can do about it," Lam says. "Audiences want to see Hong Kong films. People love Cantonese swearing because it releases tension and reinforces their Hong Kong identity."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Artist Kacey Wong Kwok-choi, an assistant professor of design at Polytechnic University, says anxiety over the city's future has been a recurring theme in locally produced art. When those tensions seep into mainstream culture such as films, it is because the anger has become too obvious to ignore, he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"People are culturally battling against mainland suppression," Wong says. "In the past only a small artistic crowd felt that, but now it is the feeling of the masses. People feel that they have to safeguard their city's system and culture."</p>Mainland media have picked up on this intense Hongkongness. An essay by a writer giving the name Yi Dongying, published on April 15 on the website <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Sina.com</span></a> criticised Hong Kong films for favouring a local identity over a wider Chinese one. "Why does a small place like Hong Kong have its own core values?" the writer asked. The essay was widely shared - and disparaged - by Hong Kong readers.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fruit Chan says Hong Kong people have moved from colonial era apathy to concern and even action. In the 1997 trilogy, the characters were marginalised. In , deserted Hong Kong is the character that has been sidelined by mainland influence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Local politics also stars in the independent documentary by British filmmaker Matthew Torne, currently being screened at Metroplex Cinema in Kowloon Bay. By following two teenage activists, the movie critiques Beijing's mounting control over the city and the widespread belief that Leung's administration's has acquiesced to that control. In 2012, Joshua Wong Chi-fung of student-led group Scholarism led the fight against a proposed national education curriculum that praised the Communist Party. Ma Jai, a member of the League of Social Democrats, became radicalised through his opposition to then president Hu Jintao.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Torne, an Oxford graduate who examined Hong Kong's politics and identity for his graduation thesis, says he wanted to understand what it means to be a Hongkonger. He says Wong and Ma represent a new generation who have cast off the refugee mentality of their parents and grandparents, who treated Hong Kong as a stepping stone to somewhere else.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"This is their town, and this is what gives them an identity," Torne says of the two teenagers. "They fight. They stand up and protect their city."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The benefit of social unrest, notes Torne, is better art. More Hong Kong films, he says, are made for locals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whether the current wave of political mainstream cinema will drive audiences to take to the streets is debated. Tanya Chan, Civic Party vice-chairwoman and convenor of a group supporting the non-violent civil disobedience movement Occupy Central, believes the recent films might boost creativity in the city, but doubts they will have a direct impact on the public's political choices. "You need to have a sense of identity and to care about your city in order to stay creative," she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, Fruit Chan pledges to continue with his Hong Kong-centric storytelling. "We must treasure the identity and freedom we have now," he says. "I don't want to leave Hong Kong."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Fear and loathing on the silver screen</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuQbW9ycGdofKexwKtkmqaUYrmwrdOhoKefXZi2r7HMmmSnnadis6q4zKxkq52WobKkwIympp2doqN6tbHNrKCopqNitbC6xmaiqKaX</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffear-and-loathing-cinema-new-films-reflect-modern-tensions-hong-kong.html&text=Fear%20and%20loathing%20at%20the%20cinema%3a%20new%20films%20reflect%20modern%20tensions%20in%20Hong%20Kong&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffear-and-loathing-cinema-new-films-reflect-modern-tensions-hong-kong.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffear-and-loathing-cinema-new-films-reflect-modern-tensions-hong-kong.html&title=Fear%20and%20loathing%20at%20the%20cinema%3a%20new%20films%20reflect%20modern%20tensions%20in%20Hong%20Kong" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffear-and-loathing-cinema-new-films-reflect-modern-tensions-hong-kong.html&title=Fear%20and%20loathing%20at%20the%20cinema%3a%20new%20films%20reflect%20modern%20tensions%20in%20Hong%20Kong" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffear-and-loathing-cinema-new-films-reflect-modern-tensions-hong-kong.html&title=Fear%20and%20loathing%20at%20the%20cinema%3a%20new%20films%20reflect%20modern%20tensions%20in%20Hong%20Kong" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffear-and-loathing-cinema-new-films-reflect-modern-tensions-hong-kong.html&description=Fear%20and%20loathing%20at%20the%20cinema%3a%20new%20films%20reflect%20modern%20tensions%20in%20Hong%20Kong" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./new-editor-approved-products-winter-2023-8401030.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ive Tried Countless Things This Season, but Only 7 Leveled Up My Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./brad-pitts-style-evolution-over-years-casual-dapper-how-he-went-jeans-tees-and-blond-hair-90s-suits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brad Pitts style evolution over the years, from casual to dapper: how he went from jeans, tees an">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

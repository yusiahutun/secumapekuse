According to Wealthy Persons, Nate Diaz's net worth is <a id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/mma-net-worth/nate-diaz-net-worth/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$10 million</a>. The turning point of his career was when he defeated the established fighter Conor McGregor at UFC 196 on March 5, 2016. If you are wondering how much did Nate Diaz make in UFC 196, better believe that it is peanuts compared to what he made during their rematch in UFC 202.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3076476e9e40d0f4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Canelo Alvarez: parents, wife, ethnicity, family, background</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2019, Nate also earned some good money when he defeated Antony Pettis at UFC 241 in a unanimous decision. Just for showing up, Nate was guaranteed a sum of $250,000. Add to that a portion of Pay Per View revenue; it was a good payday for Diaz.</p><h3>Nate Diaz's career earnings</h3><p class=align-left>The American pro mixed martial artist is currently signed by the Ultimate Fighting Championship(UFC). His entry into the UFC is traced back to the Ultimate Fighter 5 which he won and has since been competing in the Lightweight division of the UFC. He has already fought about 30 matches boasting a record of 19 wins 4 of which are by knockout, 12 by submission and the other three by decision. All those wins can only mean one thing, big money.</p><p class=align-left>The Stockton native might have been absent from the fight scene in 2019, but he was making big money moves off the ring as well. For starters, he has been devoting more time to his new CBD company, Game Up Nutrition. He has been recognized for making CBD products mainstream with his post-fight vape pen usage during the UFC 202 fight with Conor McGregor. All eyes will be on <a href=#>the star</a> in 2020 to see if he will return to fight and against who.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e3cd883976bd3254.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tommy Feight bio: net worth, house, career, Mercedes Javid relationship</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The fighter has made quite a fortune by winning bonus awards and Fight of the Night Awards.

She is a gold identification bearer as well as one of the game’s official tennis umpires. She was born in Croatia. Cicak is well-known among players and spectators alike, having officiated some of the most important matches in the sport. She has presided over two Grand Slam women’s singles finals — at Wimbledon and the US Open — as well as the Rio Olympics gold medal match between Angelique Kerber and Monica Puig.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Cicak began competing in tennis competitions when she was 12 years old. The Croatian, on the other hand, chose to retire from the sport to devote her time to refereeing. Cicak was a well-rounded athlete in her youth, succeeding in practically all of her physical endeavors and taking up tennis as a player at an early age, long before she was a known figure in the umpire’s chair. Her innate talent for sporting achievements soon extended to tennis officiating since she was born and raised in Zagreb, Croatia’s capital city. With a growing demand for umpires for satellite tournaments in her native country, Cicak, who spent her whole childhood at the same tennis club, got her first officiating qualification to work at national championships at the age of 15.</p><p>So, in the 1990s, while players like Cicak were placing Croatia on the tennis map by competing in the largest tournaments and winning Grand Slams, she was also commencing her international career. She planned to get a degree in kinesiology while continuing to the umpire as a pastime and participate in a variety of sports. Beginning in 2009, the Croatian received more elite tournaments experience as a member of a combined officiating squad for the ATP Tour, ITF, and WTA after gaining her silver badge in 2007.</p><h3>Marija Cicak Career</h3><p>Cicak served as chair umpire for the Women’s Singles final at Wimbledon in 2014 and the Women’s Doubles final three years later. She also officiated the 2016 Olympic Women’s Singles gold medal match in Rio de Janeiro. At this year’s Wimbledon men’s singles final, history will be made. Marija Cicak will become the competition’s first female seat umpire in its 144-year existence. On Sunday, the 43-year-old will referee the men’s singles final between Novak Djokovic and Matteo Berrettini at the All England Club, becoming the first female to do so since the championship began in 1877.</p><h4>History</h4><p>Croatian official Marija Cicak made history by overseeing the 2021 Wimbledon men’s final, a match in which World No. 1 Novak Djokovic was tipped to rewrite history. Cicak is the first woman umpire to call the match between Djokovic and Matteo Berrettini on Centre Court at Wimbledon. Cicak has written history by becoming the first woman to umpire the Wimbledon men’s singles final since the Grand Slam event’s debut in 1877 while sitting in the renowned elevated chair. The All England Club had previously announced Cicak, a Croatian, as the umpire for the Wimbledon men’s final. Cicak’s notable career as a tennis official includes officiating the 2014 Wimbledon women’s final between Petra Kvitova and Eugenie Bouchard.</p><p>Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina defeated Chan Hao-ching and Monica Niculescu in the 2017 women’s doubles final, which was referred by the Cicak. Cicak, a Zagreb native, has worked in the Olympics in Athens, London, and Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and has 15 years of Wimbledon experience. Marija umpired the women’s singles final at the Olympics. Cicak has held a gold identity for ten years and has been a WTA member since 2012. She has a long history with Wimbledon, having worked at the tournament for the past 15 years.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Marija Cicak Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Marija Čičak</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>14 June 1978</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>43Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Croatia</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Croatian</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Tennis Umpire</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Gemini</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marija-Cicak-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 11” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 181 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 67 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 147 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>9 (US)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marija-Cicak-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Is she a Lesbian?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Boyfriend</td><td>Mona Barthel</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Talking about her personal life then she is kind of complicated because she is a supporter of the LGBTQ community.

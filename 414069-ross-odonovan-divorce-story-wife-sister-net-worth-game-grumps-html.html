However, his love life hasn’t been smooth sailing. He got married at some point but divorced his wife eight years later. Let's look at his career milestones, who he is currently dating, and his past <a href=#>relationships</a>.</p><h2>Profile summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Ross Kenry O'Donovan</li><li><strong>Nick name</strong>: RubberNinja/ RubberRoss/ CondomRoss</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: Australian</li><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: 17th June 1987</li><li><strong>Place of birth</strong>: Perth, Australia</li><li><strong>Horoscope</strong>: Gemini</li><li><strong>Profession</strong>: Animator, video content creator</li><li><strong>Net worth</strong>: $100,000- $1 million</li><li><strong>Marital status</strong>: Single</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Alex Kompo: Former Siesta Key star's life and latest updates</span></p></a><h2>Early life</h2><p class=align-left>Ross O’Donovan was born on 17th June 1987. Born to Irish parents, Donovan was raised in a close-knit family, which comprised his parents and sister, Rebecca. He attended the Film and Television Institute of Western Australia and the Corpus Christi College for further <a href=#>education</a>.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>The 34-year-old’s career began immediately after graduating from college. Ross’ path to <a href=#>gaming success</a> can be attributed to personal resilience, determination, and ambition. Below is a list of some of his great works:</p><ul><li><i>Gamer Tonight</i></li><li><i>Good Game</i></li><li><i>Gameoverse</i></li><li><i>Let’s Play</i> (Web series)</li></ul><p class=align-left>Ross is also the main host of the <i>Steam Train</i>, where he co-hosts with <a href=#>Danny</a>. He has an optimistic tone, and it is not easy to associate his accent with an Australian's. O'Donovan likes to describe his voice as an "international voice."</p><h3>Did Ross leave <i>Game Grumps</i>?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg><p class=align-left>O'Donovan's presence in <i>Game Grumps</i>-related shows has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reduced gradually</a>. However, he has not yet left the show. Instead, he has taken a back seat to concentration wholly on his animation career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/983b40415f243d8a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jeremy Rytky: What you should know about Andrea Barber's ex-husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nonetheless, Ross still appears on the side of the <i>10 Minute Power Hour</i> set watching the show. He has even guest-starred the show twice. His net worth also keeps on growing. Currently, his net worth allegedly ranges between $100,000 and $1 million.</p><h2>Dating history, marriage, and divorce</h2><p class=align-left>Is Ross O'Donovan married? Ross found love in the gorgeous cosplayer, prop maker, and co-presenter Holly Conrad. The two exchanged their marriage vows on 29th September 2012. The couple always exuded the semblance of the perfect couple.</p><p class=align-left>Is Ross still married to Holly? No, they are not. Their fate in love ended in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">undisputable divorce</a>, and the ex-couple has since maintained their friendship. The first announcement for the Holly and Ross split came from the couple on their respective Twitter handles.</p><p class=align-left>They attributed their separation to Conrad's recent move to Seattle, claiming that it would have been difficult for them to sustain a long-distance relationship. When ross O'Donovan's divorce news came out, the couple’s fans were caught unaware.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15e9f05c9a7b3703.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sandi Graham: 7 interesting facts about rapper Drake's mom</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The "friendly divorce" didn’t seem to make much sense to many people. Also, the couple had not been involved in any public scandals. Their fan base even went ahead to wonder how they would manage their cat and pigeons after separation. But, things seem okay as we have not heard any altercation from the couple regarding their <a href=#>pets</a>.</p><h3>Is Ross O’Donovan currently in a relationship?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9cf369c646209f55.jpg><p class=align-left>Since ending his first marriage in 2018, O'Donovan's love life has been under wraps, and fans are itching to know who Ross O'Donovan's wife is now. Quite frankly, the YouTube sensation is<a id=https://www.datingcelebs.com/who-is-ross-odonovan-dating/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> single</a> and seems to enjoy it.</p><p class=align-left>However, due to the many people scrutinizing his love life, Ross likes to play mind games on his followers. For example, on 1st February 2020, he tweeted:</p>My girlfriend just sent me a picture of our new cat. I’m deathly curious how Orph will react. Everyone, meet Kipper.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a4d85375c3e6be05.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>BatDad net worth in 2021?

Ross <a id=https://queencitykettlebell.com/real-pet-lsqlq/ross-o%27donovan-girlfriend-2020-4416f2 href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relationship status</a> is a tricky question to answer. Considering he has been keeping his love life away from the public, he is presumably single. Either way, if he's happy, we are delighted too.</p><p class=align-left>Not only is Ross O’Donovan free-spirited, but he also lives it up. He sparks his audience with different sorts of entertainment, which is probably why he has a vast social media following. At 34 years old, he has made a considerable wealth of up to $1 million.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> published an article about <a href=#>Erik Spoelstra</a>.

It seems like they may have confirmed it with their latest public outing, but fans aren’t best pleased with the Bodak Yellow singer.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> started dating in 2017, and things moved fast as they ‘secretly’ tied the knot that same year. In 2018, they welcomed their first child, Kulture. Their relationship had its fair share of ups and downs, with <a href=#>Cardi B</a> even filing for divorce in 2020. It didn’t last though, as the divorce was later called off and they welcomed their second child, Wave in 2021. However, they called it <a href=#>quits again in December 2023</a>, when the mom of two confirmed she was single. It looks like that may have all changed once again…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/05/GettyImages-1463259350-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cardi-b-and-offset-look-cozy-as-they-attend-new-york-knicks-game>Cardi B and Offset ‘look cozy’ as they attend New York Knicks game</h2><p>Caught on cam! The <a href=#>music</a> stars weren’t hiding at Tuesday night’s Knicks game, as they looked happier than ever as they appeared on the screen.</p><p>They could both be seen smiling and waving to the cameras as cheers erupted in the crowd. Before the game, the Migos rapper was seen placing his hand on Cardi’s lower back.</p><p>The pair looked dapper for the occasion, as the WAP singer showed off her Birkin bag whilst wearing a blue checkered shirt and mini skirt, accessorizing with glasses and bright pink hair clips. The father of five was also ‘flashing the cash’ wearing a Chanel headscarf.</p><p>Cardi confirmed she was single in December, although she did admit to ‘hooking up’ with her ‘ex’ on New Year’s Eve.</p><p>Since then, the pair have fueled many rumors that things were back on track. In February, they were seen leaving a Miami restaurant on Valentine’s Day, just months after confirming they had split.</p><p>In March, the 31-year-old dropped the music video to her single, Like What (Freestyle) which was directed by Offset.</p><p>Although no official word from either of them, the video says a thousand words.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-aren-t-best-pleased>Fans aren’t best pleased</h2><p>After all the ups and downs in the relationship, surrounded with rumors Offset had been unfaithful, and even admitting it himself in 2018, fans thought it was over for good this time.</p><p>“I only have one birthday wish, and that’s to get my wife back,” he said in a video posted to <a href=#>Instagram</a> in December 2018. The rapper <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Cardi he was sorry for “breaking your heart, breaking our promise, breaking God’s promise, and being a selfish, messed-up husband. I wanna be able to spend the rest of my life with you.”</p><p>Now, they’ve realized it’s not, and they’ve taken to X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a> to express their disappointment.</p><p>“Nooo why she always goes back to him,” wrote one fan.</p><p>Another claimed: “He’s going to cheat on her again in the next 3 business days.”</p><p>A third disappointed fan penned: “This is not what we wanted @iamcardib.”</p><p>“They are so toxic it’s not even funny,” penned a fourth.</p><p>However, not everyone was feeling negative about the video, as one commented: “It’s always great to see power couples enjoying a night out together.”</p><p>Offset also spoke about the impact of hurtful rumors on their relationship on the Call Her Daddy podcast.</p><p>He said: “Because I feel like people dive into the negativity. Also, I feel like there be like a hate train of people that don’t like my wife. And she does everything else to the T, so that’s the only thing you can attack. We all humans but at the end of the day, it does affect home.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmltX2V%2BcK%2FAq5uiZZJirq%2BwjKidn6uVqXqptc2tZK2gla6%2FpnnBmpqkZaSktKbAx56pZpmjYsGpsdhmqq2doGK8tsCMn6arZZSWwaZ5zaKeoaxdl8K1ecWapaxlkaeyr8CMm5ysrF2luaat0p6baA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcardi-b-and-offset-hint-theyre-back-together-as-they-step-out-for-date-night-but-fans-arent-best-pleased.html&text=Cardi%20B%20and%20Offset%20hint%20they%27re%20%27back%20together%27%20as%20they%20step%20out%20for%20date%20night%20but%20fans%20aren%27t%20best&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcardi-b-and-offset-hint-theyre-back-together-as-they-step-out-for-date-night-but-fans-arent-best-pleased.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcardi-b-and-offset-hint-theyre-back-together-as-they-step-out-for-date-night-but-fans-arent-best-pleased.html&title=Cardi%20B%20and%20Offset%20hint%20they%27re%20%27back%20together%27%20as%20they%20step%20out%20for%20date%20night%20but%20fans%20aren%27t%20best" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcardi-b-and-offset-hint-theyre-back-together-as-they-step-out-for-date-night-but-fans-arent-best-pleased.html&title=Cardi%20B%20and%20Offset%20hint%20they%27re%20%27back%20together%27%20as%20they%20step%20out%20for%20date%20night%20but%20fans%20aren%27t%20best" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcardi-b-and-offset-hint-theyre-back-together-as-they-step-out-for-date-night-but-fans-arent-best-pleased.html&title=Cardi%20B%20and%20Offset%20hint%20they%27re%20%27back%20together%27%20as%20they%20step%20out%20for%20date%20night%20but%20fans%20aren%27t%20best" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcardi-b-and-offset-hint-theyre-back-together-as-they-step-out-for-date-night-but-fans-arent-best-pleased.html&description=Cardi%20B%20and%20Offset%20hint%20they%27re%20%27back%20together%27%20as%20they%20step%20out%20for%20date%20night%20but%20fans%20aren%27t%20best" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./luton-player-award-secondary-school-32063946.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fans love Luton's player of the month trophy that's 'like being back in secondary school'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ben-napier-weight-loss-photos-fitness-workout-secrets.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Napier Weight Loss Photos: Then and Now Pictures of HGTV Star">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

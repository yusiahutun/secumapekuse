It’s no wonder that everyone wants to know about her.</strong></p><p>Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel has become a subject of fascination among netizens and her parents’ fans thanks to her intriguing background and impressive lineage. Her mother, Bryce Dallas Howard, is an American actress and movie director recognized for her notable performances in films such as Spider-Man 3 and Jurassic World.</p><p>Likewise, her father, Seth Gabel, is well-known for his prominent role in the FOX TV series, “Fringe.” With such widely acclaimed parents, it’s only natural for Beatrice to be thrust into the limelight.</p><p>But even with this bit of information, the question remains: Who exactly is Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-1_20_56_16.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Beatrice_Jean_Howard-Gabel></span>Meet Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel was born on January 19, 2012, in the United States of America. She follows the Christian faith and has a mixed Jewish, Germanic, and British heritage.&nbsp;</p><p>The diversity of Beatrice’s ancestry isn’t the only exciting thing about her family. What truly sets her family apart is that it boasts several Hollywood stars. For instance, Beatrice is the granddaughter of Ronald William Howard, a highly acclaimed American film director, producer, and actor. Moreover, her aunts, Paige Howard and Jocelyn Howard, are also established Hollywood actresses.</p><p>Despite Beatrice’s family’s popularity, her parents prefer to keep her personal life private. As a result, the name and location of her school are unknown, among other personal details.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Beatrice_Jean_Howard-Gabels_Grand-Dad_Announced_Her_Birth></span>Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel’s Grand-Dad Announced Her Birth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When little Beatrice, weighing 8lbs 6oz, was born, her grandfather Ron Howard, announced the news through his Twitter account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-30_16_2_5.jpg><p>In his tweet, he mentioned that Beatrice’s father and her brother Theodore Norman Howard-Gabel were excited and joyful about adding a new family member. Before Beatrice was born, her mother openly shared her experience during pregnancy and mentioned that she and her son had predicted the arrival of a baby girl.</p><p>However, despite knowing the gender, Beatrice’s parents chose to keep it a surprise until her birth. Beatrice’s mother also discussed her struggles with severe postpartum depression after giving birth to her first child. She revealed that her battle with the condition lasted for 18 months, but through the use of homeopathic treatment, she was able to overcome it.</p><p>During an interview in 2018, Bryce revealed that due to her horrifying experience, she was initially scared that the same problem would happen after Beatrice’s birth. However, she found solace in knowing she had her family and friends’ support.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Little_More_About_Beatrices_Parents></span>A Little More About Beatrice’s Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Beatrice’s dad, Seth Gabel, is an American actor born on October 3, 1981, known for his roles in television shows like Salem and Nip/Tuck. He is also the grand-nephew of actor Martin Gabel. Seth was raised in Hollywood, Florida, as part of a Jewish family and took on the surname of his stepfather, Cosentino, who adopted him.</p><p>He completed his high school education at the University School of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida, in 1999. Later, he attended New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. It was during his youth that he became best friends with Josh Gad.</p><p>Beatrice’s mom, Bryce, was born in March 1981 in Los Angeles. She has gained recognition for her roles in films such as The Help, Rocketman, and the Jurassic World franchise. Recently, Bryce transitioned into directing and worked on several episodes of the popular Disney+ series, The Mandalorian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-30_16_4_47.jpg><p>Beatrice’s parents met at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. What initially started as a friendship blossomed into a deep and meaningful romance. After nurturing their bond for five years, the pair decided to take their relationship to the next level and get married.</p><p>They exchanged vows and tied the knot on June 17, 2006, in Greenwich, Connecticut. On February 16, 2007, Howard and Gabel welcomed their first child, Theodore Norman Howard-Gabel. Like his sister, most of his life is kept from the public eye.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Beatrice_Jean_Howard-Gabel_and_Chris_Pratts_Son_Friendship></span>Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel and Chris Pratt’s Son Friendship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Beatrice’s mother, who acted alongside Chris Pratt in the action/sci-fi movie Jurassic World, shared in an interview with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres that their children have a fantastic friendship and really like each other.

Bryce added that they would make great in-laws. She expressed her belief in the lasting power of their friendship. She even hinted at the potential for Beatrice and Jack to collaborate on something shortly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-30_16_7_15.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Beatrice_Jean_Howard-Gabels_Social_Media_Following_and_Net_Worth></span>Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel’s Social Media Following and Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Beatrice Jean Howard-Gabel isn’t active on any social media platforms. Being relatively young, she hasn’t yet taken on managing a social media account. But she often features on her mum’s <a href=#>Instagram </a>posts. Likewise, it’s hard to determine her net worth, as she’s still a child and hasn’t embarked on a professional career or started earning.</p><p>Another attractive celebrity child making waves lately is Chris Brown’s son, <a href=#>Catori Brown</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kr6at06ugnJ1dn7KiuoyhprCZopl6qK3BnqNmmZyherq71Galnp2UYsGwecqnprBlkZe8tsCMrZ%2Biq12Ysq2xwaugrbFdoLalew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbeatrice-jean-howard-gabel-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-celebrity-kid.html&text=Beatrice%20Jean%20Howard-Gabel%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20This%20Celebrity%20Kid&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeatrice-jean-howard-gabel-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-celebrity-kid.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeatrice-jean-howard-gabel-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-celebrity-kid.html&title=Beatrice%20Jean%20Howard-Gabel%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20This%20Celebrity%20Kid" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbeatrice-jean-howard-gabel-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-celebrity-kid.html&title=Beatrice%20Jean%20Howard-Gabel%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20This%20Celebrity%20Kid" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbeatrice-jean-howard-gabel-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-celebrity-kid.html&title=Beatrice%20Jean%20Howard-Gabel%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20This%20Celebrity%20Kid" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeatrice-jean-howard-gabel-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-celebrity-kid.html&description=Beatrice%20Jean%20Howard-Gabel%3a%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20About%20This%20Celebrity%20Kid" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meet-chef-behind-sri-lankas-most-famous.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Singapores chilli crab inspired one of Sri Lankas best restaurants">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./inspiring-looks-for-weekend-brunch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Best Brunch Outfits for Women 2023">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

Here are seven exciting facts on Kayla Varner you need to know.</p><h3>1. Kayla was raised Mormon and is still firm on her faith</h3><p class=align-left>The young athlete was born Kayla (née) Varner on November 4th, 1992 in Henderson, Nevada. Quick math should tell you that her current age is 27. She grew up in the same town with her two brothers, McKay and Markus. Moreover, her parents, Sean and Lizz Varner raised them Mormon and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Edd China biography: wife, children and net worth</p><p class=align-left>Up to this day, all three siblings keep up with the faith and uphold their Mormon values. This is evident when McKay and Markus took up missionary work in Charlottesville, West Virginia that led them to Lima in Peru. Aside from that, Kayla Varner still holds the church dear and often posts pictures of it on her Instagram page. She even had her wedding ceremony at the San Diego Mormon Temple.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c8edea257553f549.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Montana Helena Klein Yao: What you should know about Malik Beasley's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>“I dreamt of being sealed in the San Diego Temple, and Bryce agreed that this was the right place for us,” she revealed in an interview with The Knot News. Kayla also added that her marriage was centred on religion and that she regarded temple marriage very sacred. More on that later.</p><h3>2. Her love for soccer began at the Green Valley High School</h3><p class=align-left>Kayla Varner attended the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Green Valley High School</a> in Henderson, Nevada and tried out for the football team. After playing for one season, her talents and skills ranked her highest, and she was made Captain of the Green Valley Gators. With her leadership, agility, and speed, the team easily made it to the playoffs each year for the next three seasons.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Rebecca Claire Miller: biography and relationship with Sean Spicer</p><p class=align-left>During her tenure as captain, the Gators won two Sunrise conference titles and three Southeast division trophies. One of her most significant accomplishments was leading her team to victory at the 2011 Nevada State Championship. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Varner’s stats </a>had 112 goals scored and 83 assists during her four years in high school soccer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/19faf54bd668e07f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Steven Crowder's wife? Everything you should know about Hilary Crowder</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Did you also know that Kayla played for Brigham Young University Cougars for two seasons? She scored one goal, assisted in over 33 games and won by a penalty kick in the 2012 NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen. Soon after, she enrolled at the Ohio State University and played for the Ohio Buckeyes under coach Lori Walker.</p><h3>3. She met her husband, Bryce Harper, in high school and married him in 2016</h3><p class=align-left>Kayla met her current husband, Bryce Harper, while they were both in high school. She said, “He’s the most selfless guy ever… I think that’s what always attracted me to him. And he’s goofy and funny—he loves to play pranks on me, and as much as I get annoyed by it, I secretly love it—he’s just the best. I love him.”</p><p class=align-left>Even though their love stood the test of time, it seldom made it. Initially, Kayla was set to become Bryce Harper’s wife in January 2015 following their engagement in 2014. However, they cancelled the wedding without any formal reasons. Rumour had it that the couple broke up since they each unfollowed each other on social media.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0ff1a6d1da109908.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Faith Hill's daughters now: names, profiles, careers, ages, photos</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Jon Grissom biography, Corey Feldman accusations, facts</p><p class=align-left>Nonetheless, about a year later, they were spotted in July at the ESPY Awards. The one thing that suggested they were back together was Kayla Varner’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">engagement ring</a> made from diamonds. So when did Bryce Harper get married finally? On December 17th, 2016 the couple finally tied the knot at the San Diego Mormon Temple and had their reception at the San Diego Polo Fields. Kayla called the ceremony, “The Sequel.”</p><h3>4. She is a new mother of one</h3><p class=align-left>A happily ever after isn’t the only thing that worked out for the newlyweds. For starters, Bryce signed a 13-year deal with the Philadelphia that would see him paid <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$330 million</a>. A while later the couple revealed that they were expecting their first child together in August 2019.</p><p class=align-left>When the day finally came, Kayla gave both to their firstborn son, Krew Aron Harper on August 22nd, 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to sources</a>, their son was born healthy weighing 7 pounds, 9 ounces and 19 inches. The baseball player took to his Instagram and shared a photo of his new family while at the hospital.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cb83cec1fdb8ce48.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kerri Browitt Caviezel: The untold story of Jim Caviezel's wife</span></p></a><h3>5. Kayla Varner is huge on philanthropy</h3><p class=align-left>Krew Aron Harper will grow up surrounded by love and virtue. Not only will he grow up Mormon as both his parents but will also learn the value of giving back to society. Bryce is huge on philanthropy and through his influence helped raise funds for the charity work, Harper’s Heroes. It’s a charitable organisation mostly for children battling cancer.</p><p class=align-left>When you donate, part of the funds will go towards helping the less fortunate. Kayla also supports her husband through all his endeavours – whether it was cheering him on from the stance or charity. She also promotes the Alliance for Haiti’s Children Education Transforms programs through her Twitter handle, where she posts images and links on her bio.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Tia Torres husband, kids, family and net worth</p><h3>6. She loves dogs and gushes at the sight of food</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a7264258c37931a8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Emily Jendrisak: The interesting life story of Gavin McInnes' wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Aside from football, Varner enjoys a ton of hobbies. Typically, reading, watching movies, shopping, and dining out make her day. At a glance, her Instagram reveals so many memories of her family and friends, but you’ll also find snaps of the food she likes making cameos in her feed. But wait there’s more.</p><p class=align-left>Bryce Harper and Kayla Varner also set up another Instagram account called Harp Eats that showcases their love for food. The couple may not be reality stars, but their Instagram documents all the food they have eaten over the past year. The mother of one likes trying out new restaurants and drags her husband along too. She lives by the code: food is better than a "summer body."</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, Varner is a dog lover. Other than her boys, she also showers love to her dog named Wrigley – or as she likes to call him, Wriggles. The adorable pup is a Morkie; a crossbreed between a Maltese and a Yorkie. Wrigley is currently five years old and often appears on her Instagram. To give you a better picture of how much she loves Wrigley, Kayla celebrates the dog’s birthday.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/30ed8ddaed75de82.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jenna Fischer net worth 2021: How wealthy is 'The Office' actress</span></p></a><h3>7. Her net worth is impressive</h3><p class=align-left>Kayla Varner’s net worth amounts to approximately $300,000 according to online sources. Though this figure is nothing close to her husband’s net worth of $70 million, it still shows how much she’s accumulated through her career. Some of her most significant <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accomplishments</a> include winning the following:</p><ul><li>2009 NSCAA All-American Team selection</li><li>NSCAA 2009 All-Region Team selection</li><li>2009 and 2011 Nevada High School Player of the Year</li><li>2011 NSCAA Senior Excellence Award Winner</li><li>2011 Las Vegas Athletics Club Outstanding Female Athlete</li><li>2011 Nevada State 4A High School Champions</li></ul><p class=align-left>So how does the family spend their wealth you ask? Well, Bryce and his wife live in an enormous mansion right off a golf course in Henderson, Nevada. They bought it back in 2016 for a total of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$2.7 million</a>. The property covers a total area of 7,395 square feet and boasts of five bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also has a beautiful pool to go with it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/755ffcde4fb8baef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Harper Hempel: 5 things you didn't know about Jamal Murray's girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It’s a good thing that both athletes were raised humble and never flaunt their wealth on social media. Kayla prefers to keep things private and will go at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">great lengths</a> to protect her family.</p><p class=align-left>Kayla Varner Harper makes a terrific mother and wife to Bryce Harper. So far, there haven’t been any marriage-breaking rumours and cheating allegations between the two. Their love story is certainly one worth telling to generations to come. Kayla Varner doesn’t talk much about her personal life but instead expresses her experiences through her Instagram.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Leann Rimes net worth, husband, children, then and now</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkWppcG1doK66uMBmrZqqnpq%2FboOMn5icrKNir7PFwp5koZmipbKzv4ywoJ%2BdXp3Brrg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f321275-kayla-varner-7-facts-bryce-harpers-wife-html.html&text=Kayla%20Varner%3a%207%20facts%20about%20Bryce%20Harper%27s%20wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f321275-kayla-varner-7-facts-bryce-harpers-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f321275-kayla-varner-7-facts-bryce-harpers-wife-html.html&title=Kayla%20Varner%3a%207%20facts%20about%20Bryce%20Harper%27s%20wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f321275-kayla-varner-7-facts-bryce-harpers-wife-html.html&title=Kayla%20Varner%3a%207%20facts%20about%20Bryce%20Harper%27s%20wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f321275-kayla-varner-7-facts-bryce-harpers-wife-html.html&title=Kayla%20Varner%3a%207%20facts%20about%20Bryce%20Harper%27s%20wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f321275-kayla-varner-7-facts-bryce-harpers-wife-html.html&description=Kayla%20Varner%3a%207%20facts%20about%20Bryce%20Harper%27s%20wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./never-jump-in-a-leaf-pile.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Never Jump in Leaf Piles">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jamboree-in-the-hills-changes-hands-as-part-of-live-nation-spin-off.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamboree In The Hills Changes Hands As Part Of Live Nation Spin-Off">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

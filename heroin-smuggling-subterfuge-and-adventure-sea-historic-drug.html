He grew his hair and wore a hoop earring to be deployed undercover in Wan Chai bars if someone was suspected of selling drugs, usually cocaine or cannabis.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong smuggling, sea battles and saving refugees</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his book, Mason not only tells how the Clinker sting unfolds, but provides the reader with a condensed history of narcotics in Hong Kong, beginning with opium and the growing importance to the city’s illegal-drugs trade of the Golden Triangle (a major drug production centre in the region where Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having also spent time policing the lawless Kowloon Walled City, he also gives a breakdown of the various triad societies, when and how they were founded, and their traditions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But, above all, Operation Clinker is a story of high adventure, with smugglers deceived and caught on the high seas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/02/15/790c4834-65ce-11eb-bc00-908c10a5850a_972x_163932.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the summer of 1988, an unemployed Canadian yacht skipper, John Bridges, was in the Philippine capital, Manila, hoping for a sailing gig when he was approached by Roberto Baptista in a Makati bar. A Filipino in his late 50s, Baptista befriended Bridges and said he wanted to sail to Australia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a few meetings, Baptista asked Bridges to help him buy a yacht, hire a crew and sail it to Australia via Hong Kong. Bridges agreed to the proposal, but, feeling suspicious, he decided to report the request to the Australian consulate in Manila.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mike Howard, then acting superintendent of operations in the international or section of the Royal Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau, was contacted by the Australian Federal Police, who relayed the information.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/02/15/38a9d784-65ce-11eb-bc00-908c10a5850a_972x_163932.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So we got a few weeks’ warning that the yacht was coming and initially thought we’d just put surveillance on it,” says Mason, who was one of three chief Inspectors working for Howard. The wait paid off when the yacht arrived in August 1988 and moored at the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club in Causeway Bay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A team of 60 police officers were deployed to watch Baptista and two senior 14K triad standard bearers who were involved in the goings-on. The police team was based in a suite in the now-demolished Excelsior hotel overlooking the yacht club, yet it was weeks before they discovered what the Filipino planned to smuggle to Australia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a stroke of luck for the police, Baptista instructed Bridges to sack the Filipino crew and recruit European sailors, who he felt would be less conspicuous entering Australia. So the skipper knowingly hired four undercover officers – Mason, young Marine Police officer Bill Renwick, who sailed his father’s yacht and played in the Hong Kong rugby team, and two others, one of whom was a woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/02/15/fa474be8-65cd-11eb-bc00-908c10a5850a_972x_163932.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There was a lot of excitement and anticipation,” says Mason, who assumed the role of a merchant navy officer on leave who fancied sailing a yacht down to Australia. The vessel, called the Oui, was a 45-foot, two-masted sailing boat, with room for six people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The police had an audacious plan – to intercept the yacht on its voyage near the Po Toi Islands, just off the southern coast of Hong Kong Island, with police officers dressed as civilians.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They would arrest Baptista, and persuade him his prison term would be reduced if he assisted the police. Then, after a few weeks, they would fly Baptista to Australia to take part in a ruse to bust the criminals there, as well as the syndicate in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Just before the yacht sailed from Hong Kong, a tattooed triad enforcer, former bouncer Wong Hon-man, 24, boarded. He was there to watch over both Baptista and the illicit haul. The police had seen Baptista put a heavy bag on board and suspected it was narcotics, but had no proof. As the yacht headed out towards Po Toi, a transponder in Mason’s case helped his colleagues track the boat.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We had a microphone so we could hear people talking. One of the Australian syndicate criminals cracked open one of the blocks of ‘heroin’ and the dust flew up and covered everyone present in luminous dyeMike Howard, then acting superintendent of operations in the international or section of the Royal Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, the undercover officers settled into the role of transient crew members setting off on a cruise to Australia. “The first CD we put on was Rod Stewart’s I am Sailing,” says Mason. “Another one was Dignity by Deacon Blue,” another song on the same theme.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The officers were keyed up and ready. “I think our main fear was that we would do something wrong and blow the case,” Mason says.</p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Les Bird</span></a>, a Marine Police officer, was chosen to pilot the interceptor vessel, a large catamaran. Howard, Superintendent Chris Cantley, and three other officers were also on board dressed in Hawaiian shirts – acting like a group of partygoers enjoying a beer-fuelled boating trip.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/02/15/c0ada0ac-65ce-11eb-bc00-908c10a5850a_972x_163932.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A short time before the yacht was intercepted, Mason says, the catamaran developed mechanical problems in one engine, which affected its speed and steering. The weather was worsening and, in the dark, Bird was forced to ram the catamaran into the Oui. Three police officers jumped onto the yacht.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On board, Mason and Renwick subdued and arrested Baptista, Wong and Bridges – to maintain the deception Bridges was part of the gang. They then searched for the heroin, which turned out to be a 43kg haul stowed in the yacht’s fresh water tanks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We opened the portside tank and there was just a couple of kilos in there, which elicited enormous disappointment,” Mason says. “But when we opened the starboard tank, it was stacked to the brim.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once the arrested trio had been taken off the yacht, Renwick and Mason raised a skull-and-crossbones flag Mason had hand-sewn – a lighthearted gesture to announce they had seized control.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/02/15/d23432f6-65cd-11eb-bc00-908c10a5850a_972x_163932.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The yacht was soon repainted and renamed off the Po Toi Islands to give the impression that the Oui had left Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several weeks later, Howard flew to Australia to liaise with the Australian Federal Police. As part of the ruse, Bridges, Wong and Baptista were also flown in. Officers had substituted plaster of Paris for 41kg of the heroin, leaving 2kg intact, and the haul was handed over to members of the Australian syndicate in an apartment in the northern Sydney suburb of Artarmon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We had a microphone so we could hear people talking,” Howard told the Post. “One of the Australian syndicate criminals cracked open one of the blocks of ‘heroin’ and the dust flew up and covered everyone present in luminous dye.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A Swat team rappelled down from a helicopter onto the roof; they let flashbangs go off in the flat. It was really exciting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/02/15/59682570-65ce-11eb-bc00-908c10a5850a_972x_163932.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/02/15/717305b8-65ce-11eb-bc00-908c10a5850a_972x_163932.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The operation resulted in multiple arrests in both Hong Kong and Australia, and serious damage to both syndicates. Baptista was sentenced to 11 years in prison and Wong to nine after testifying against the others.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To celebrate, the Hong Kong police team dined at the Lamma Hilton seafood restaurant in Sok Kwu Wan. The guest of honour was the head of the Narcotics Bureau at the time and future police commissioner, Tsang Yam-pui, the brother of subsequent Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang Yam-kuen. In the centre of the table was a flag bearing a skull and crossbones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR9kWltbm1fnbKzu8inZKylpZy0rbXNoGSsrZKpsrOy1KCcZpmemXqisNWepa2topp6tLHAZp%2Biq6Skv6qvjJ2prp8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheroin-smuggling-subterfuge-and-adventure-sea-historic-drug.html&text=Heroin%20smuggling%2c%20subterfuge%20and%20adventure%20at%20sea%3a%20historic%20drug%20bust%20off%20Hong%20Kong%20recalled%20in%20new%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheroin-smuggling-subterfuge-and-adventure-sea-historic-drug.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheroin-smuggling-subterfuge-and-adventure-sea-historic-drug.html&title=Heroin%20smuggling%2c%20subterfuge%20and%20adventure%20at%20sea%3a%20historic%20drug%20bust%20off%20Hong%20Kong%20recalled%20in%20new%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheroin-smuggling-subterfuge-and-adventure-sea-historic-drug.html&title=Heroin%20smuggling%2c%20subterfuge%20and%20adventure%20at%20sea%3a%20historic%20drug%20bust%20off%20Hong%20Kong%20recalled%20in%20new%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheroin-smuggling-subterfuge-and-adventure-sea-historic-drug.html&title=Heroin%20smuggling%2c%20subterfuge%20and%20adventure%20at%20sea%3a%20historic%20drug%20bust%20off%20Hong%20Kong%20recalled%20in%20new%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheroin-smuggling-subterfuge-and-adventure-sea-historic-drug.html&description=Heroin%20smuggling%2c%20subterfuge%20and%20adventure%20at%20sea%3a%20historic%20drug%20bust%20off%20Hong%20Kong%20recalled%20in%20new%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./schiaparelli-spring-2024-lobster-dress.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Schiaparelli Made Lobster Dresses Inspired by Salvador Dali">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elizabeth-hurley-son-damian-directed-sex-scene-strictly-confidential.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elizabeth Hurley Defends Lesbian Sex Scene Directed By Son In New Movie">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

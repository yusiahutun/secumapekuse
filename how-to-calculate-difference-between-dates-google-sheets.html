Read on to learn what this function is, and see it in action with a simple example.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-datedif-function-in-google-sheets>What Is the DATEDIF Function in Google Sheets?</h2><p>DATEDIF is a Google Sheets function that calculates the difference between two dates. This function can return the difference value in years, months, or days. With the proper parameters, DATEDIF can also return the months and days difference with various quirks, such as ignoring the year difference.</p><p>The syntax for the DATEDIF function is as below:</p><pre><code class=hljs>=DATEDIF(date1, date2, unit)</code> </pre><p>DATEDIF subtracts date2 from date1 and then returns the difference in the specified unit. The units this function supports are listed here:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Unit</p></th><th scope=col><p>Note</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Y</p></td><td><p>Number of whole years between the two dates.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>M</p></td><td><p>Number of whole months between the two dates.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>D</p></td><td><p>Number of days between the two dates.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MD</p></td><td><p>Number of days between the two dates, where whole years and months are subtracted.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>YM</p></td><td><p>Number of whole months between the two dates, where whole years are subtracted.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>YD</p></td><td><p>Number of days between the two dates, where the two dates are considered no more than a year apart.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's use an example to better understand what each of these units means for the DATEDIF function.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/datedif-units-sheets.jpg><p>As an example, we have a student's birthday, which is February 7th, 2001. Using DATEDIF you can indicate how old the student was on January 31st, 2022. Here's what each unit would return with the DATEDIF function:</p><ul><li><strong>Y</strong>: This will return 20, as the difference between the two dates is 20 whole years.</li><li><strong>M</strong>: This will return 251, as the difference between the two dates is 251 whole months.</li><li><strong>D</strong>: This will return 7663 since 7663 days have passed between the two dates.</li><li><strong>MD</strong>: This will return 24. Once the whole years and whole months are subtracted, the difference between the two dates is the day difference, which is the difference between 7 and 31, which in turn equals 24.</li><li><strong>YM</strong>: This will return 11. After the whole years are subtracted, February is 11 months away from January.</li><li><strong>YD</strong>: This will return 358. If the years are ignored, the difference between February 7th and January 31st is 358 days.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-use-the-datedif-function-in-google-sheets>How to Use the DATEDIF Function in Google Sheets</h2><p>The DATEDIF function takes three parameters: The first date, the second date, and the unit. The dates you enter must be in the date format, and not text. The units are also limited to the ones mentioned in the previous section. With these in mind, let's put this function to use.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/datedif-mars-sample.jpg><p>As a simple example, we have a spreadsheet with the launch and touchdown dates for the Mars 2020 mission. According to this spreadsheet, the spacecraft took off on July 30th, 2020, and landed on Mars on February 18th, 2021.</p><p>The goal is to calculate the number of days and months that this spacecraft has traveled. You can use the DATEDIF function in Google Sheets for that. First, you need to make sure that your cells are in the correct format:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><li>Select the cells containing the dates.</li><li>Go to <strong>Format</strong> menu and then select <strong>Number</strong>.</li><li>From the number formats, select <strong>Date</strong>. This will set the selected cells to date format.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-2023-03-20-133437.jpg><p>With the formatting all set, now it's time to calculate the difference using DATEDIF:</p><li>Select the cell where you want to display the date difference in days. That will be cell <strong>B4</strong> in this spreadsheet.</li><li>Go to the formula bar and enter the formula below:<pre><code class="hljs xml">=DATEDIF(B2, B3, <span class=hljs-string>"d"</span>)</code> </pre></li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><p>Google Sheets will now tell you that the spacecraft has traveled for 569 days. The formula calls on DATEDIF to calculate the difference between dates <strong>B2 </strong>and <strong>B3 </strong>in days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can calculate how many months the spacecraft has traveled by tweaking the unit in DATEDIF:</p><li>Select the cell where you want to display the date difference in months.

The formula here is the same as before, except that it returns the difference in months rather than days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/datedif-birthday-sample.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's strengthen this skill with another example. In the spreadsheet above, we have John Doe’s birthdate. The goal is to calculate how many days have passed since his last birthday, and how many days are left until his next birthday.</p><p>To achieve this, you can <a href=#>use the TODAY function to input today’s date in Google Sheets</a> and then calculate the difference between today's and John’s birthdate using the DATEDIF function.</p><li>Select the cell where you have input the first date. This will be cell <strong>B1</strong> for this example.</li><li>Go to <strong>Format</strong> and then <strong>Numbers</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Date</strong>. This will change the cell format to date.</li><li>Select the cell where you want to show the current date. This will be cell <strong>B2</strong> for this example.</li><li>Go to the formula bar and enter the formula below:<pre><code class=hljs>=TODAY()</code> </pre></li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><p>This formula will get today’s date and display it in the cell.

The <strong>YD </strong>parameter instructs the function to suppose that the two dates are no more than a year apart. Once you press Enter, Google Sheets will tell you how many days it has been since John’s last birthday, which is 331 in this example at this time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sheets-datedif-yd.jpg><p>As a side objective, let’s see how many days are left until John’s next birthday. John’s birthdays repeat every 365 days, and if 284 days have passed since his last birthday, then 365 - 284 days are left until his next birthday. Let’s write a formula for this:</p><li>Select a cell where you want to show the formula results. That will be cell <strong>B4</strong> for this example.</li><li>Enter the formula below in the formula bar:<pre><code class=hljs>=365-B3</code> </pre></li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><p>This formula will subtract the days passed since John’s last birthday from 365, and tell you how many days are left until John’s next birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sheets-datedif-subtraction.jpg><p>Alternatively, you can also calculate the difference between two dates by <a href=#>converting the dates to numbers in Google Sheets</a>.

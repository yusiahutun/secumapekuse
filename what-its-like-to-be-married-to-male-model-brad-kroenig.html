On the first night of our trip, we stood in the lobby of our hotel, waiting for the valet to bring our car around. It was one of those perfect summer nights, where the ocean is twinkling and the air feels like a warm bath. I was wearing a black jumpsuit and sandals, the boys were in jeans, t-shirts and sneakers. I think we were going out to seafood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then a group of women came into the lobby dressed like they were going to a bachelorette party, all sparkles and one-shoulder tank tops. There may have been a tiara. Someone must have recognized him because all of a sudden, they started shouting, "Brad! Brad!" In unison, literally screaming his name. They're like "Come out Brad, come party with us! Brad!" He just kind of looks at me and we're both smirking, and he doesn't want to be rude so he just looks over to them and nods and says, "Thank you," and we walked around the corner. We got our car, and drove to dinner and had a lovely evening. But, I couldn't get that out of my mind for a few days.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"My husband is not an actor, or a popstar or a politician. He is, however, handsome. He's 6'1"-square-jaw-dirty-blonde-five-'o-clock-shadow-handsome. If you saw him, he's so handsome it might take your breath away, or you'd at least turn your head."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My husband is not an actor, or a popstar&nbsp;or a politician. He is, however, handsome. He's 6'1"-square-jaw-dirty-blonde-five-'o-clock-shadow-handsome. If you saw him, he's so handsome it might take your breath away, or you'd at least turn your head. (I'm not saying this to brag, I'm saying this because I've seen it happen to many women. It happened at lunch this weekend. It happened on vacation last week.) But if you weren't a part of that fashion world, that's probably all you'd notice about him before gathering yourself and moving on. If you were a part of the fashion world, you'd know that Brad is a model, and arguably, one of the most famous male models in the world. He's done campaigns for Chanel, Fendi, Hermes and Tiffanys. He's worked with Karl Lagerfeld for more than twelve years, over which time he's become family to us. Every summer, we spend a few weeks at his home in the South of France. Karl is the godfather to our children&nbsp;and takes an important and active&nbsp;role in their lives.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We laugh when things like that night in Newport happen, or when women leave notes at the front desk of hotels for him, or when flight attendants slip him their numbers. We have to laugh. It's not a challenge to our relationship, and it doesn't bother me or change us, but it's something I don't think&nbsp;every woman has to deal with. I don't think every woman stands in a hotel lobby with her two children and her partner at her side and has a group of other women asking him out as though she isn't even there.</p><img alt="Clothing, Footwear, Leg, Product, Sleeve, Shoulder, Standing, Joint, Dress, White, " title="Clothing, Footwear, Leg, Product, Sleeve, Shoulder, Standing, Joint, Dress, White, " width=2429 height=3036 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/07/1455711891-hdm020116hbznicolek003.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tyler Joe</span><p>Nicole with&nbsp;their youngest son Jameson, wearing a Balenciaga dress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you met Brad, you'd like him. He's charming and charismatic and hilarious and kind. That's just who he is. But nine years ago, when a friend wanted to introduce us, I had no intention of meeting him, let alone liking him. I was still living in Florida, where I'm from, and he was coming down to visit a mutual friend, who thought we should meet. She told me he was a model, which I wish she hadn't, and then we Googled him together, which I wish I hadn't. Immediately that made me hesitant. I thought a guy with that career and that lifestyle could only be looking for one thing: A fun weekend. Some women may have been interested in that, but I was not.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was Cinco de Mayo that weekend, and I already had plans so I gracefully skipped the dinner our friend had arranged. The next day, I was working in the real estate office of the community where our friend had a home. I was in jeans and an American Apparel v-neck, no makeup—it was Saturday—and I think I had just stopped by the office to pick up my mail and boom! I ran right into Brad. (Our friend had seen my car pull in and let him know.) Of course, I was attracted to him immediately. But what I really remember was thinking how nice and down-to-earth he was, which made him even more attractive. I think we both laughed, and he said I had to go out to dinner with him that night since I'd blown him off the night before. How could I say no?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We went to sushi, we drank sake, we drank more sake, and from then on, it was pretty much on. As weird as this sounds, we talked about our future that very first night. And we've pretty much been together ever since. I always say that Brad and I met at the perfect time. He'd had a lot of fun before we met, he's dated models, he's had that life. One month before or one month after and it might not have worked out. In fact, I know it wouldn't have. We met at just the right moment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the beginning of our relationship, I joked that I was always dating a different guy because Brad changed his hair color so often. But that's not to say he's Zoolander. When we go out, it's not like he's in the bathroom for hours getting ready beforehand. We're both pretty low maintenance on that front. His eyebrows are better groomed than mine, I will give him that. But does he watch what he eats? Absolutely. Does he exercise? Completely. For me, that can be a blessing and a curse. Right now he's on a sort of strict, calorie counting routine. A few weeks ago, I came upstairs from working out in our gym and found he'd made me a big salad. Sitting next to it was a piece of paper with a whole breakdown of if I were to do the same program—my target calories, fat intake, carbs, protein. He's like, 'I'll measure your lean body mass and we can get you started." And I'm like, "Oh no you won't!" He meant well, but I was momentarily annoyed.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"A few weeks ago, I came upstairs from working out in our gym and found he'd made me a big salad.

But I'm also camera shy. I prefer to be on the other side. My Instagram is pictures of Brad and the boys, and rarely one of me. For a few campaigns lately, Brad's been photographed with our boys and a model playing their mother. My mom's friends are always asking, "When are we going to see you on there?" That's the last thing I would want! The few times we've had to be photographed together—including for this story—I completely clam up. I'm so awkward. It's not good—which makes me more than happy to leave the modeling to the men in our family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Brad's good looks and incredible work ethic are what makes our life possible, so for me to start focusing on being bitter, or jealous&nbsp;or resentful—that's ridiculous. Do I love seeing shoots where his pelvis is pressed against a naked model? I mean I don't love it. But honestly I have to laugh. I just know him so well. I know he's thinking about whether his body looks right or if he's posing correctly or if the client is getting the shot they need. Those shoots are just business for us—I don't look at them as sexual. What's actually more strange to me is how free other women feel to ask me all sorts of personal questions. Not many women straight-up ask each other if they're afraid their husband will cheat, and yet I get asked that question all the time. Could he if he wanted? Sure. But I don't dwell on that negative possibility. Trust is paramount in any successful relationship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That being said, knowing the world that Brad comes from—of hot young models with perfect bodies—that does keep me on my toes. That's what's normal to him. I want to be healthy for myself and my children, first and foremost. But if I totally let myself go or if I don't try to keep myself fit, I don't think that's right. He keeps himself up physically and I try to do the same. I'm not saying I have a perfect body, but I work at it—and if that means counting calories on little slips of paper, so be it. We're going be together for a long time—you've got to keep both parties happy.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"This may sound cheesy, but there's a quote I recently heard that describes our relationship best. There's one that says, 'He chooses me every day.'"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This may sound cheesy, but there's a quote I recently heard that describes our relationship best. There's one that says, "He chooses me every day." Because, you know, he does, and vice versa. We don't have to do this. We don't have to raise our children together, and be together, and have this life. We don't have to do any of this. He could run off with another woman, or women, and do his thing. He chooses me, he chooses us as a family. And I love that, every day.</p><img alt="Clothing, Arm, Leg, Product, People, Sleeve, Trousers, Collar, Shoulder, Shirt, " title="Clothing, Arm, Leg, Product, People, Sleeve, Trousers, Collar, Shoulder, Shirt, " width=2400 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/07/1455711532-hdm020116hbznicolek002.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tyler Joe</span><p>Brad wears a&nbsp;Dior Homme suit,&nbsp;Nicole wears a Chanel dress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hair and makeup:&nbsp;<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.miguellledo.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miguel LLedo" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Miguel LLedo</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fashion editor:&nbsp;<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/author/1644/chrissy-rutherford/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chrissy Rutherford" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Chrissy Rutherford</a></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/7c5a8de0-eff8-4d3b-8c43-0f9e885df433_1612209267.jpeg alt="Headshot of Hannah Morrill" title="Headshot of Hannah Morrill" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Hannah Morrill is a writer and editor based in Portland, Maine.

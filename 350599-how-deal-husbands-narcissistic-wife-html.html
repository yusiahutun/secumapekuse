Everything looks promising, and your partner becomes your best friend. When falling in love, one thing you need to be aware of is your new partner’s past. New lovers who were once married can bring a lot of baggage with them. Married people who later divorce their partners do not instantly cut contacts as they have a lot that they share. You may have fallen for such a guy and are still struggling with how to deal with your husband’s narcissistic ex-wife. The baggage brought by your formerly married husband could be in the form of property, children, or worse, narcissistic ex-partners.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4b7bcbf393d70f7a.jpg><p class=align-left>Starting a relationship or even getting married to a man with a narcissistic ex-wife requires some level of patience that not everyone has. One thing you need to understand is that you cannot hide away from the problem. You need to deal with every issue that arises and be transparent on how you feel about your husband’s former wife. Tell him if you like or do not appreciate the presence of his former partner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf339000f4853033.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to stop loving the father of your child as a single mom</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The ex-wife may be more successful or even more gorgeous than you. So do you know what to do you when your husband’s ex-wife is beautiful? Ignore. Do not think of being insecure. Love your new man and forget about the distraction that is the ex-wife. Being upfront with your husband will save you a significant headache and help you build a solid foundation for your marriage.</p><h2>How to deal with your husband’s narcissistic ex-wife</h2><p class=align-left>These 12 tips will help you deal with a narcissistic ex-wife:</p><h3>1. Talk to your husband</h3><p class=align-left>Your husband is the common factor between you and the annoying ex-wife. Make time and have a long talk on how your lives may be affected by the ex-wife. Have him understand what you feel about the wife. Make your husband explain to you the presence of his ex-wife in his life.</p><p class=align-left>Some divorces do not mean that former spouses have to cut contact permanently as they may have had children before the divorce and other joint investments. Being in business partnerships means that your husband and his ex will have to bump into each other often. Let the man explain how their interactions will be henceforth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf339000f4853033.jpg><h3>2. Make peace with the fact that they won’t change</h3><p class=align-left>You may ignore the threats and aggressive behaviour, expecting that the ex-wife will one day get sense and change. It is good to be hopeful but also realistic. Dealing with your husband’s ex-wife is not a walk in the park. The ex-wife probably despises you and blames you for the break-up.</p><p class=align-left>Someone who loathes you will go the extra mile to annoy you. Do not sit pretty, waiting for a change in behaviour. What you should do instead is make peace with the fact that the ex may be a thorn in you and your husband’s lives for a long time. Meanwhile, you can try and do things that will help in your mental stability.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Cute things to text your girlfriend to make her smile</p><h3>3. Set boundaries</h3><p class=align-left>It is the first cardinal rule once you get into a new relationship. Your husband may love you with everything he has, but the psycho ex-wife may be an invisible stumbling block to your new love. Set boundaries for both yourself and your current husband, and adhere to the ground rules.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/04b8e9715d55e602.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Setting appropriate boundaries with baby mama to avoid drama</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ensure that neither parties break the rules as that may be the start of another crisis in waiting. Setting boundaries is necessary as it will help you uphold the right approach as you have fun in your new relationship.</p><h3>4. Be gentle but bold</h3><p class=align-left>Try and contain your anger even when you feel like they have pissed you off. It is okay to be angry as every human has limits. Being polite, however, goes a long way. Be respectful and stand your ground whenever you are interacting with her.</p><p class=align-left>Your conversations with probably infuriate her as the target is your husband. Maintain your composure when talking with her and maybe advise your husband to do the same. Self-control is crucial at this time, as either party may get to be irritated unprovoked.</p><h3>5. Limit contact</h3><p class=align-left>Continuous interaction with the ex-wife is how your new family will break into pieces. Exes can be vile and toxic. The more you expose your lives to them, the more they learn about your weak points. Shelter your home from the despicable ex and even be extra if you have to protect your income from your husband’s ex-wife.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>8 ways to win a girl who rejected you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The exes may take advantage of the information they gather from you and plan on how to destroy your new family. It is advisable to respond to her messages when necessary. This includes emergencies or situations where they are in desperate need of help. Checking up on them will only fuel more hatred as she may feel like you robbed her of the good life you are enjoying.</p><h3>6. Concentrate on your family</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg><p class=align-left>Your family is the most important thing for you. Ignoring your husband’s past may be difficult, but try as much as you can to focus on the new family you have acquired. All attention should be on your family, no matter how troublesome the toxic ex-wife is.</p><p class=align-left>A little distraction may make things go south and lead to you losing your loved ones. You surely do not want to lose something you value over bothersome people who do not matter in your new life. Do you?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5aa879800d66801e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 biggest pet peeves in relationships that will drive you crazy</span></p></a><h3>7. Silence is golden</h3><p class=align-left>Some people deal with things that trouble them by speaking their minds out. Others deal with stuff by sitting on them until they disappear. In a situation that involves a narcissistic ex-wife, silence can be golden. You do not have to say out loud everything you think of as some of the things you say cannot be unsaid.</p><p class=align-left>The narcissistic ex-wife hates you, and you probably feel the same about her. Be quiet sometimes to save your family the agony of having to deal with things that should have remained unsaid. Narcissistic ex-wives fancy attention. Your talking will be feeding their craving for attention.</p><h3>8. Control your emotions</h3><p class=align-left>Try your level best to contain your feelings. The narcissistic ex-wife will use every way possible to irk you. Your expressing of emotions will give her more reason to annoy you. One common sign of a bitter ex-wife syndrome is forcing themselves into your life and wanting to read your feelings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs4fde3qus2l1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Types of relationships you will encounter in your love life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Do not give her the privilege of knowing what you feel at whatever time. By reading your feelings, she will know where to hit you where it hurts most. Shut her off and act disinterested whenever she is present.</p><h3>9. Don’t be dramatic in public</h3><p class=align-left>No one likes a dramatic person. Being dramatic, especially in public, will only bring unending embarrassment to your family. The narcissistic ex-wife may approach you in public to start a fight. So how do you deal with a narcissistic ex-wife who thrives on drama? Avoid retaliation.</p><p class=align-left>Fight the temptation to show that you are more powerful than her. Refrain from making a scene in public. Be the bigger person and keep moving. Don’t try to make sense with her as she plans to humiliate you and cause you embarrassment when everyone is watching.</p><h3>10. Don’t disrespect her in front of the children</h3><p class=align-left>Children should never be part of conflicts that involve adults. You may dislike and even hate her character, but never display your anger in front of your children. Do not try to recruit your child to be in your army. You are their mother; they will side with you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d7a7b04845b764b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best savage quotes for your ex</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Making them hate your husband’s ex will only escalate the issue. The children do not need the negativity in their innocent lives.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to know she loves you in a distance relationship?</p><h3>11.Quit being an over-sharer</h3><p class=align-left>Learn to keep some things to yourself. You may think that by sharing bits of your life, you are making her admire you. It is not the case. You are only setting yourself up for more misery and disgrace. Only say what is necessary any time you talk to her.</p><p class=align-left>Tell your husband not to share your achievements or fails with the former wife. You can only have the peace you require by keeping her in the dark.</p><h3>12. Link up with a support group</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6fd63c02f8cf3ccb.jpg><p class=align-left>It may not be a common practice, but joining a support group will do wonders for your mental health.

Do not make your home a sad chamber by entertaining negativity that will make you depressed all the time. Forget about the ex-wife and, more importantly, do not let her insecurities get into you. Your husband chose you because he loves you. The ex-partner means nothing to him. Focus on the positives only.

He is renowned for his cunning, keen sense of timing, and use of feints.</strong></p><p>It is even more extraordinary when we consider that he was rotting on the Manchester City bench just three years back.</p><p>However, that is far from the situation now as Sancho is the star player of his club, Borussia Dortmund.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jadon-Sancho-1.webp><p>Moreover, many elite clubs are preparing for a battle to land the young prodigy due to his outstanding form.</p><p>However, that is in the future. And we are not here to talk about the future.</p><p>Instead, we are here to inform you about Jadon’s early life to his present career, and all that happened in between. So without wasting another second, let’s get started.</p><h2>Quick Facts:</h2><table><tbody readability=4.2391304347826><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Jadon Malik Sancho</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>March 25, 2000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Camberwell, England</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>English, Trinidadian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>23 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>Mixed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s name</strong></td><td>Sean Sancho</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s name</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td>Winger</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Clubs</strong></td><td>Borussia Dortmund (Current), Manchester City (Former)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Player agent</strong></td><td>Elite Project Group Ltd</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>76 kg (167 lb)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Girlfriend</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>One daughter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jersey Number</strong></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td>€112,000 per week</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td><strong>$8 million</strong></td></tr><tr readability=1.9130434782609><td><strong>Online Presence</strong></td><td><a href=#>Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Merch</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Posters, </a><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Card</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>December, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Jadon Sancho | Early Life & Family</h2><p>Jadon Malik Sancho was born to his parents, <strong>Sean Sancho</strong> and an unnamed mother, on March 25, 2000, in Camberwell, London.</p><p>Besides that, there is no information about his siblings, either. While growing up, Sancho was a die-hard Chelsea fan as they were from the same area.</p><p>On top of that, he idolized Chelsea legend and current manager <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank Lampard</a></strong>&nbsp;during his early years.</p><p>However, he joined the Watford academy as Chelsea’s academy was a bit too far to be traveling daily.</p><p>Thereafter, he remained with Watford until the age of 14 when Manchester City came in and swooped the young prodigy.</p><p>Subsequently, he remained on the south side of the City until 2017 before moving to Borrusia Dortmund. The reason is a lack of playing time under manager <strong>Pep Guardiola</strong>.</p><h2>How Old Is Jadon Sancho? Age, Height & Position</h2><p>Jadon took birth in the year 2000, which makes him 23&nbsp;years of age currently. Likewise, the Camberwell native celebrates his birthday on the 25th of March.</p><p>Thus, he falls under the sign of the Zodiac when it comes to the horoscope. Talking about Sancho’s height, he stands at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) and weighs 76 kg.</p><p>Now talking about his physique, Sancho has a well-toned and healthy body. Likewise, to keep himself active and fit, Jadon also does different workouts and eats a balanced diet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jadon-Sancho-Doing-The-Workout.-1.webp><p>Furthermore, Sancho predominantly plays as a right-winger cum attacker who likes to cut inside and score goals using both his feet.</p><p>Added to that, Jadon is one of the trickiest players out there with an array of skills under his locker.</p><p>Also, let’s not forget his blistering pace, which can leave even the best defenders on their backside.</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p>Regarding his nationality, Sancho was born in Camberwell, which is a district in London. Hence, he is an English citizen.</p><p>Interestingly,<strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tammy Abraham</a></strong> of Chelsea also comes from the same area. In fact, the two are best friends who often share fun posts on their Instagram handles.</p><h2>Jadon Sancho | Career & Stats</h2><p>As of now, Jadon has only played for Borussia Dortmund as a professional. Likewise, he made his debut on October 21, 2017, against Eintracht Frankfurt.</p><p>After that, he played in a further 12 games scoring one goal.</p><p>Although he did not score many goals, his performances were so brilliant that he warranted a starting place in the Dortmund side the next season.</p><p>Subsequently, Jadon lifted his game with more playing time as he scored 13 goals in 41 appearances for the club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jadon-Sancho-In-The-Field.-1.jpg><p>Thus having had an excellent 2018-19 season, everyone expected the England international to kick on and become even better.</p><p>And staying true to everyone’s expectations, Sancho has scored an impressive 17 goals and provided a further 19 assists in just 35 games this season.</p><p>As a result, Premier League clubs Manchester United and Chelsea are vying for the signature of the talented player.</p><h3>International</h3><p>The international CV of Jadon is not as impressive as his club’s because he is still quite young. Added to that, Sancho has only made 11 appearances so far, in which he has scored two goals.</p><p>However, because he&nbsp;is already considered a starting player for England, we are confident that Jadon can reach the daunting 100 cap mark.</p><p>You might also want to read: <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Erling Haaland Bio: Stats, Father, Goals, Contract, TransferMarkt Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>How Much Is Jadon Sancho Worth? Net Worth & Lifestyle</h2><p>As of 2023, Jadon has a net worth of <strong>$8 million</strong> accrued mainly through his activities as a professional footballer.</p><p>Although he has only played one full professional season, he has quickly become one of the world’s best young players, which means more wages.</p><p>Likewise, just before starting this season, Sancho signed a new contract that will see him pocket a cool <strong>€6 million per year</strong> or <strong>€112,000 per week</strong> as his salary until the end of 2022.</p><p>However, in light of his outrageous form that has seen him score a total of 17 goals and 19 assists in just 35 games, Borussia Dortmund is willing to offer Jadon <strong>€10 million per year</strong>.</p><p>Hence, it remains to be seen whether Jadon remains at Dortmund or moves elsewhere.</p><h3>Transfer</h3><p>If you have been following the transfer news, you must know that Sancho is a hot topic in the market.</p><p>Moreover, with Chelsea and Manchester United vying for his signature, among others, it is sure to be a transfer battle to remember.</p><p>As per multiple reports, Dortmund is only willing to sell Sancho if they get <strong>€130 million</strong> in return.</p><p>Even though it is an absurd amount of money for a 23-year-old, contrarily, considering the crazy inflation in transfer fees recently, we feel that Sancho is worth the money.</p><h2>Does Jadon Sancho Have A Child? Girlfriend & Daughter</h2><p>Moving onto Sancho’s love affairs, he has not been in any kind of public relations. The reason we say this is because Jadon<i>&nbsp;</i>has a daughter who is about two years old.</p><p>But, unfortunately, the name of the little girl remains undisclosed. Moreover, the mother of the child also remains hidden from the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sanchos-Daughter.png><p>In other words, it is truly a miracle that Sancho has managed to keep his personal life extremely private in today’s technological world filled with social media platforms.</p><p>Regardless, judging from Jadon’s Instagram account, which has more than 5 million subscribers, the father and daughter duo share an extraordinary bond.</p><p>Thus, all we can say is that the beautiful girl is one lucky child to be born to a father like Sancho.</p><h2>Tattoos</h2><p>On his other arm, Sancho also has several tattoos, the majority of them, in the winger’s words, are “freestyled.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Untitled-design-7.jpg><p>The Simpsons, Spider-Man, and Sonic the Hedgehog, among other cartoon characters, are all tattooed on the right arm of the former Borussia Dortmund star.</p><h2>Social Media Presence:</h2><p>Jadon Sancho is quite active on social media.

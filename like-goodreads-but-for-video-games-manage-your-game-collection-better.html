To solve this, you can use a video game tracker service to help you manage your collection so you know what you own, what you need to complete, and what you want to buy in the future.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>We've rounded up some of the best services that you can use to keep track of your games. Think of them as the Goodreads for video games, or the Letterboxd for video games.</p><p>These are the best video game trackers.</p><h2 id=grouvee>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grouvee</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/grouvee.png><p>Grouvee has a nice, clean interface and is easy to navigate. It's bound to have any game you want to add because it's powered by Giant Bomb's API (a user-editable wiki).</p><p>Each video game entry contains the average rating from Grouvee users, a quick summary of the game, release date, platforms, publisher, and other useful information.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can assign a status to any game: played, playing, wishlist, backlog, and other shelf. This last option lets you create as many shelves as you'd like to further organize your games. You can also select which systems you played the game—since you might own it on multiple formats, as there are <a href=#>big differences between PC and console</a>.</p><p>Going beyond simply cataloging, Grouvee lets you leave comments to share your thoughts on the game as you play through it. The app highlights these prominently on game pages, which makes it a logical choice if you're after a Goodreads for gaming. You can also track how long it took you to finish a game and what level of completion you achieved.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=gg>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GG</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gg.png><p>GG is a stylish website that focuses on the simple features you need from a video game tracker.</p><p>You can find a specific game or look at trending or newly released games. Each game page features platform information, screenshots, videos, and the ability to add a review.</p><p>Importantly, you can quickly set your play status for each game. These include options like playing, beaten, and abandoned. Alternatively, you can create your own custom list if none of these options suit.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>One downside to GG is that you need a paid membership to clone existing lists or merge your own. This can make it quite cumbersome when you first create your game collection as you have to go into each game manually. You also can't specify which platform you own the game on.</p><h2 id=completionator>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Completionator</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Completionator.png><p>Completionator is a fantastic choice as a simple video game tracker, but it's also packed full of extra features that make it especially good.</p><p>It's really easy to create your game collection because you can import your Steam library. You can also import a list that you have manually created. This makes it a breeze to create your library quickly.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You get lots of options to track video games, like what platform you own the games on, what condition they're in, your current play status, and more. You can also find out an estimated value for your collection.</p><p>Something that makes Completionator different is its social aspect. It has a forum where you can chat with others. More interesting, though, is the ability to complete challenges set by other people. This is like a book club, where you all agree to complete a game and discuss it after.</p><h2 id=howlongtobeat>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HowLongToBeat</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HowLongToBeat.png><p>As you might guess from the name, HowLongToBeat was designed as a way to find out the length of a game. That's useful to know if you have a limited amount of time to play or want to crack through your backlog with the shortest games—which is one way to <a href=#>decide what game to buy next</a>.</p><p>The site also functions as a video game tracker. You can add games to your backlog and mark them as various states of completed, like whether you only tackled the main story or if you went all out and did the extras too.</p><p>You can import your Steam games, which is excellent and convenient, and HowLongToBeat will add them to your catalog. If you want, you can then sort through these to see how long you will spend playing each one.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The site is powered by community contribution, so be sure to let others know how long it takes you to complete a game once you've finished with it.</p><h2 id=darkadia>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darkadia</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Darkadia.png><p>When most of our games are digital nowadays, it's a shame to miss out on the satisfaction of seeing everything lined up on shelves—an important factor when <a href=#>comparing physical games against digital games</a>. That's where video game tracker Darkadia comes in, which brings your virtual collection to life.</p><p>Once you add a game to your shelf, you can then browse through all of them at a glance. Click into a game and you can see information about it, like its release date and developer.</p><p>Importantly, there are many ways to tag your collection. You can mark the different play states (like completed or mastered) and you can also track the date you achieved these and how long it took.</p><p>Two excellent features include the ability to add private notes to a game (perhaps to record its digital game key), plus the ability to export your collection so that you're not tied into Darkadia's platform.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=the-backloggery>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Backloggery</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backloggery.png><p>Backloggery is a simple service compared to others listed here, but it still works as a way to catalog your video games.</p><p>The biggest difference between Backloggery and the other systems is that it doesn't provide integration with a video game database and so you don't get to see box art, screenshots, or other nice features. Instead of adding specific game entries to your account, you're presented with a number of blank fields.</p><p>You can fill in the name, system, and region of the game before adding its status, ownership status, and review information. You can keep track of how many achievements you've earned, whether you're currently playing the game, and whether it's on your video game wishlist.</p><p>Although this provides some flexibility to manage your games however you'd like, it's more cumbersome an experience than the other sites due to the manual nature. Nevertheless, if you want a simple video game tracker, Backloggery serves its purpose.</p><h2 id=backloggd>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Backloggd</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/backloggd.jpg><p>Backloggd is a free service to track your video games from all platforms. You can log the games you own, are currently playing, and have played. You can also build a wishlist, since Backloggd's catalog includes games which aren't yet released.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Your library is easily searchable through filters and sorting mechanisms, and you can rate and review games to remind yourself of what you thought of them. Plus, there's an active community, so you can engage with other players and compare your libraries.</p><p>If you love data, Backloggd has you covered. It provides extensive stats about your library, like your top genres, how the library has grown over the years, your favored platforms, the ownership breakdown (digital, subscription, or physical), and so much more.</p><p>All of this comes on a video game tracker website that is well-designed, easy to navigate, and continually updated. It's an excellent choice.</p><h2 id=organize-your-collection-with-game-launchers>Organize Your Collection With Game Launchers</h2><p>The game tracking service you decide to go for will depend on your needs—whether you want to import from Steam, crave social features, and so on. Take a look at all the ones we've covered and see which works best for you. Then enjoy tracking your video games!</p><p>We've covered how to track your entire video game collection across all platforms. You might also want to consider organizing all your PC games into a single launcher for easy accessibility.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fobassYygpqicopqupb%2BMm6ytZZakv27CyJ2cqGWXlrqmv4ymmKeZl5p6urvUq2SgmZ2aeqS7y6WcnKyZpLtursStq56qXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flike-goodreads-but-for-video-games-manage-your-game-collection-better.html&text=The%20Best%20Video%20Game%20Tracker%20Apps%20%28Like%20Goodreads%20for%20Video%20Games%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flike-goodreads-but-for-video-games-manage-your-game-collection-better.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flike-goodreads-but-for-video-games-manage-your-game-collection-better.html&title=The%20Best%20Video%20Game%20Tracker%20Apps%20%28Like%20Goodreads%20for%20Video%20Games%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flike-goodreads-but-for-video-games-manage-your-game-collection-better.html&title=The%20Best%20Video%20Game%20Tracker%20Apps%20%28Like%20Goodreads%20for%20Video%20Games%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flike-goodreads-but-for-video-games-manage-your-game-collection-better.html&title=The%20Best%20Video%20Game%20Tracker%20Apps%20%28Like%20Goodreads%20for%20Video%20Games%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flike-goodreads-but-for-video-games-manage-your-game-collection-better.html&description=The%20Best%20Video%20Game%20Tracker%20Apps%20%28Like%20Goodreads%20for%20Video%20Games%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emilia-clarke.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Emilia Clarke dating?

The incredible hotel occupies eighteen floors of The Shard, Western Europe's tallest building. Guests can <a class=hm-link href=#>soak up the picturesque panoramic skyline views overlooking the River Thames</a>, with beloved landmarks such as the Tate Modern, Shakespeare’s Globe, Borough Market and St Paul's Cathedral within close distance. The hotel is home to London's highest hotel infinity pool, so you can relax with mesmerising views.</p><p id=egnHsUM9d8RB data-wc=10><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Best vintage furniture shops in London for one-off pieces</a></strong></p><p id=eP18_Ga_0mPP data-wc=8></p><h3>The Royal Lancaster Hotel</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef5f14ae94bb-royal-lancaster-hotel-view-z.jpg><p id=ewxj10sxdzER style=text-align:center data-wc=11><strong>The views of Hyde Park from the Royal Lancaster are incredible</strong></p><p id=e7S7k7cf79sD data-wc=26>Conveniently located just behind Lancaster Gate tube, the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Royal Lancaster hotel</a> in London boasts views across Hyde Park and London which are literally to die for.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKOqbtMMJ78M data-wc=72>The extravagant yet elegantly-designed interiors make this hotel feel completely luxurious. Corridors of marble, with the contemporary touches of velvet chairs and sofas, and minimalistic brass and white lamps, give plenty to feast your eyes on inside the hotel. But once shown to your room (the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>park suites</a> are spectacular - the entire width of one side of the hotel with wrap-around windows), the views outside will really take your breath away.&nbsp;</p><p id=evQ5HNATJ83L data-wc=40>Directly opposite the majestic trees and lakes of Hyde Park, the Royal Lancaster gives you a central London dwelling (just 15 minutes walk to Oxford Street) with the peace and respite of the awe-inspiring royal park right on your doorstep.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNyyHr08odwJ data-wc=94>Breakfast was befitting of its 5-star status. All the staff at the Royal Lancaster were faultless; present when needed and discrete when not. Breakfast was no exception - no platters remained empty for more than a second or two, and options for all diets were plentiful. The honeycomb in the centre of the breakfast display comes right from the beehives on the roof of the hotel, and the honey theme plays out across the hotel, with delicious honey cocktails giving a sticky nod to the bee farm that can be seen from the bedrooms.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8Lt9WMEj8H5 data-wc=46>When we visited, Nipa Thai, which gets a great write up, was closed for a short spell, so we didn't get to taste the food from the all-female kitchen. The bar and lounge outside is available for bar meals though, and again the service was great.&nbsp;</p><p id=epMILJkzeh35 data-wc=46>But without a doubt, it's the rooms and suites at the hotel - and those spectacular views - that really make this establishment stand out. The space, the peace and the endless vistas create an oasis of calm in the middle of a wonderfully vibrant city.&nbsp;</p><p id=edKnI0YZCraB data-wc=8></p><h3>Leonardo Royal Hotel</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/60943d846a67-601deluxeroom9a9c79021b4cd02aec4b6c3088de8db31200x742mobile3.jpg><p id=eCee_3hLWJc data-wc=27>Did you know it's possible to stay in a hotel room with a breathtaking view of the exact cathedral in which King Charles once married Princess Diana?&nbsp;</p><p id=euUn2UD9yCm data-wc=101>Leonardo Royal Hotel St Paul’s is the place to choose if you are looking for an unforgettable stay in England's capital.

The whole hotel had a whispered luxury, and we felt right at home. Plus, they serve an authentic Japanese breakfast that my friend from Japan said is the best in London - if that's not a seal of approval, I don't know what is.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSJIhZycyp data-wc=4><strong>To book,&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">visit here</a></p><h3>11 Cadogan Gardens, Chelsea</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d91b8a71c85c-11cadogangardenssignature-suite007window-view.jpg><p id=eeIbYo92Gc3 data-wc=109>Nestled in the streets of Chelsea is 11 Cadogan Gardens, a 5-star luxury hotel in prime location.

With the Saatchi Gallery, Harrods and the V & A Museum in close proximity, there really is something for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMDfHjdtqshp data-wc=106>Located just behind the hotel is Pavilion Road, a pedestrianised mews with restaurants, cafes and boutiques galore. We’d recommend popping into Parlour by Ice Cream Union for a sorbet of dreams. This is also where Han’s Bar & Grill is located, an all-day restaurant serving up an epic breakfast all the way to a delicious dinner. The relaxed establishment is the perfect place to unwind after a long day exploring. We’d recommend the Caesar salad, just be sure to save room for the New York cheesecake. This beautiful hotel has to be at the top of your list - an oasis in the heart of Chelsea.</p><p id=eKAiTAwvvK data-wc=5><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;here</a></p><h3><strong>The Biltmore Hotel, Mayfair</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2bac87097c8f-biltmore-hotel-grosvenor-square.jpg><p id=eO-pwwkJWM data-wc=28>Just a hop, skip and a jump from the action on New Bond Street is this haven of a hotel, situated in the prestigious area of Grosvenor Square.</p><p id=eBm4rTJgyC data-wc=53>I visited the stunning hotel on a sunny evening, and after stepping through the understated entrance, was instantly ensconced in the hotel's easy grandeur; it felt like home.

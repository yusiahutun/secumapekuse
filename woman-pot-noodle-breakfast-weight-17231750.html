"I had a tough childhood and food was where I found solace. Some people turn to drink, some people turn to drugs – I turned to food."</p><p>"School was difficult. I kept my circle of friends quite small to try and avoid being teased as much as possible, so I don't think I got as badly bullied as some people do, but it was still tough," she added.</p><p>"It look me a long time to realise that eating a pack of donuts wasn't going to solve all my problems."</p><p>Back in 2009 Karen found that her binge eating wasn’t just damaging her self-esteem but also seriously affecting her health.</p><p>She even found it difficult to walk as her weight caused agonising pain in her legs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19040815.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Karen-Sharpe-370135><p>"It got to the point where I didn't want to leave the house because it was too painful to walk," she said.</p><p>Karen was desperate to change her lifestyle and went to the doctor for advice. But the medic said she wouldn’t be able to lose weight naturally and told her to join the waiting list for a gastric band.</p><p>The week after Karen decided to join Weight Watchers in a bid to kick-start the process and shift some extra pounds before the operation.</p><p>She said: "I was told the wait list for gastric surgery could take up to two years.</p><p>"I didn't want to be the way I was for another two years. My children were growing up and I just felt like I'd miss so much waiting.</p><p>"I joined Weight Watchers to try and lose a couple of stone to help with the pain of walking around before I had the surgery."</p><p>IN PICTURES: REALITY STARS WEIGHT LOSS TRANSFORMATIONS</p><a class=gallery-interaction href=# data-link-tracking=inArticle|slideshow><span>Reality stars: Then and Now</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19425832.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_1287042> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19040817.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Karen-Sharpe-370143> <span class=label>View gallery</span></a><p>But as the pounds began to melt away Karen decided to shun the surgery and slim down to her goal weight with good old-fashioned diet and exercise.</p><p>She explained: "I know people who've had surgery and, while they did lose weight, they never addressed the reasons why they were big in the first place.</p><p>"I also met a lot of people whilst on the waiting list who cheated the band, doing things like melting down Mars Bars so they could still indulge."</p><p>At the beginning of this year she’d shifted more than 10st. Then after switching to a new plan called SmartPoints she lost another 2st in just eight weeks.</p><p>The idea behind the plan is to approach weight loss holistically by using nutritional science to simplify healthy eating, as well as incorporating wellbeing and fitness skills.</p><p>***&nbsp;Chubby lad sheds 9 STONE in eight months to become personal trainer ***</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Now Karen is just 9lb away from her goal weight of 13st and she’s enjoying flaunting her new physique in slinky size 12-14 outfits.</p><p>Instead of snacking on quick-fix junk she enjoys freshly prepared healthy meals.</p><p>Although she will allow herself a "few treats" over the festive period, Karen will definitely not be indulging like she used to.</p><p>"Before, I'd have piled my plate high with food just because it was there," she said. "I also used to have loads of Baileys, which is the worst thing you can drink."</p><p>"I'll still have a few treats, but nothing major. I'll have butternut squash instead of potatoes and that sort of thing – but I'll still enjoy some pigs in blankets," she added.</p><p>"But the fact is I don't even like the kind of food I used to gorge on anymore."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Karen also makes sure to hit the gym three times a week and she’s even become a Weight Watchers leader.</p><p>She said: "My life in unrecognisable now. I can play football and run around after my children instead of sitting on a bench watching them.</p><p>"For the first time in my life, I can shop in regular high street shops. I wear things I'd never have dreamed of before.</p><p>"I used to hate myself. I didn't like mixing with people or going out. I still struggle with my confidence but I'll get there, in time."</p><p>For information see Weight Watchers.</p><p>WATCH: HOW ALCOHOL AFFECTS WEIGHT LOSS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaJyZmsFussitpZ6ro2TEsLnAp2Spp6Riu7C7w6WcZpqimq6sssCsq2avlZ60qcCMam5ra2FsgnE%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwoman-pot-noodle-breakfast-weight-17231750.html&text=Woman%20sheds%2010st%20after%20ditching%20junk%20food%3a%20%27I%20had%20Pot%20Noodle%20for%20brekkie%20every%20day%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwoman-pot-noodle-breakfast-weight-17231750.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwoman-pot-noodle-breakfast-weight-17231750.html&title=Woman%20sheds%2010st%20after%20ditching%20junk%20food%3a%20%27I%20had%20Pot%20Noodle%20for%20brekkie%20every%20day%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwoman-pot-noodle-breakfast-weight-17231750.html&title=Woman%20sheds%2010st%20after%20ditching%20junk%20food%3a%20%27I%20had%20Pot%20Noodle%20for%20brekkie%20every%20day%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwoman-pot-noodle-breakfast-weight-17231750.html&title=Woman%20sheds%2010st%20after%20ditching%20junk%20food%3a%20%27I%20had%20Pot%20Noodle%20for%20brekkie%20every%20day%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwoman-pot-noodle-breakfast-weight-17231750.html&description=Woman%20sheds%2010st%20after%20ditching%20junk%20food%3a%20%27I%20had%20Pot%20Noodle%20for%20brekkie%20every%20day%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./494401-100-basketball-captions-instagram-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="100+ best basketball captions for your Instagram photos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./juan-rafael-restrepo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Juan Rafael Restrepo dating?

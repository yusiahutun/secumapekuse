Whether it is conventional, "Should I date him," or the heart-breaking and harrowing, "I think I should break up with him", everyone's been there. What if yours is a different script, making your situation an even bigger dilemma to solve. The most commonly confusing scenario for ladies is when a guy flirts with them but are aware that they have a girlfriend. Of course, the mixed signal is quite perplexing. Matters of the heart need slow and steady moves, and that is why treading on such treacherous ground and making hasty decisions without sound reasoning can have you in tears. So, what does it mean when a guy flirts with you but has a girlfriend?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/62a4e89dc8de6313.jpeg><p class=align-left>“I have been talking to him for the past three months or so and he is showing great interest and giving mixed signals.” “We both have similar interest and generally get along well.” Such are the common sentiments that ladies have when their crush flirts with them even though they have a girlfriend.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0737f6a297635f0b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How does a guy feel when you block him? 7 thoughts on his mind</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Anyone would feel great when told such expressive words. But, unfortunately, if the wordsmith has a girlfriend, there is always a but. So, why is he flirting with you?</p><h2>What does it mean when a guy flirts with you but has a girlfriend?</h2><p class=align-left>When a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hot guy shows interest </a>in you, it can be confusing if he is in a relationship. Are you in such a situation currently? Would you like to know if your crush is genuinely interested in you and can leave his current <a href=#>girlfriend </a>for you?</p><p class=align-left>There is a lot at stake here, and you ought to tread carefully if you want to have some peace of mind. But, of course, a situation where your crush likes someone else but he still flirts with you can give you countless headaches. “Why is he still interest in me yet he has a girlfriend?”</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><h3>He likely has genuine feelings for you</h3><p class=align-left>When a guy at work flirts with you but has a girlfriend, it doesn't necessarily mean they are playing with you. Sometimes, they might have genuine feelings for you. However, even though this might be a great thing, you need to be careful while dealing with an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unfamiliar situation</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Probably he met you after his girlfriend and found you attractive and a perfect match. Humans have fleeting emotions, so it is not his fault that he feels a certain way towards you that makes you feel like he's flirting.</p><p class=align-left>If the guy confesses his feelings for you, then that is a significant step. However, it is upon you to judge the genuineness of the situation. Are they expressing their feelings so that he can pursue the relationship further? Does he care about you, or is he using you?</p><p class=align-left>Also, you need to think about his situation with his girlfriend because he eventually ought to decide what he wants and discuss it with her before he has it with you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6aa5ae642a8f5867.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs your baby daddy wants you back but is scared to tell you</span></p></a><h3>He is having problems with his girlfriend</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0737f6a297635f0b.jpg><p class=align-left>Another possible reason your crush has a girlfriend but flirts with you is that he has a relationship problem with his girlfriend. Telling you, he likes you can be his way of acting out. It might be for revenge purposes or maybe seeking comfort as he is not getting it from his girlfriend.</p><p class=align-left>It is upon you to choose whether you want to be his dirty little secret or not. However, the guy should address his issues before coming to you. Then, if he figures that he is still interested in going on with you, you can talk when the girlfriend is out of the picture. That is if you do not want to be his dirty little secret.</p><h3>He is insecure</h3><p class=align-left>If you are flirting with a guy who has a girlfriend and is insecure about his relationship, then you should avoid them like the plague. Insecure men often gamble with their <a href=#>relationships</a>, which is not a good thing. So what is to prevent them from risking your feeling as well?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e99c66cc474ef907.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 signs he doesn't care about the relationship and what to do</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In most cases, these men lack self-worth and have low confidence. Therefore, they do things that don’t end up well, probably including their current relationship. So, it is a good idea to stay away from someone flirting with you and is in such a tight spot.</p><h3>He is afraid to settle down</h3><p class=align-left>When your crush has a girlfriend but flirts with you, it can signify that he is not ready to settle down. The guy might tell you that he doesn't love his wife, but if he hasn't left her, it might be because he has commitment issues.</p><p class=align-left>In certain instances, he might find it sound to be <a href=#>married</a> and tied in a permanent relationship and have another woman on the side. Although ironic, it is simpler to date a lady who knows the guy is married and doesn't expect anything from him. It is messed up, but that is how things are.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f39ac4e902a235e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My girlfriend has a celebrity crush: Should I be worried?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The bottom line is that the guy is craving something he doesn’t get in his current relationship. Maybe he is not getting what he is craving for and is constantly looking around for one. And that is why he has commitment issues.</p><h3>The guy might find the thrill of you exciting</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg><p class=align-left>Some men like the thrill of going behind their girlfriend and wife's back. Although not many have the sentiment, they do exist.</p><p class=align-left>Of course, everyone gets a bit of thrill when doing something they shouldn't. However, in this scenario, you are putting yourself in jeopardy. Remember that a guy flirting with another lady for the thrill is likely hurting other people as well.</p><p class=align-left>If you are unsure whether he likes you and wants to be with you, you need to notice the apparent signs. If you sense otherwise or your instincts tell you that it is not right, stay away.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b99bc86ae50dc36.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sad quotes about crushes on a guy</span></p></a><h3>He wants to see if he still got it</h3><p class=align-left>If he has a girlfriend but flirts with you, then it can be a sign that he is trying to figure out if he still got it. You might have been his typical pick-up <a href=#>artist</a> back when he was single, but being in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relationship made him rusty</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The guy might be confirming whether he still has the charms to impress a lady. Of course, his pursuit will end there in most cases, but sometimes, the guy might follow it through—some like the rush of sleeping with someone new.</p><p class=align-left>If you were wondering, “What does it mean when a guy flirts with you but has a girlfriend?" the above data provides sufficient information that can give you a rough idea of where you stand. Always ascertain that you consider all possibilities before taking any action. Sometimes, it can be innocent flirting, and there is no need to make things complicated if that is the case.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37680e627e1181e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Are you trying to figure out what to comment on your girlfriend’s Instagram? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an interesting <a href=#>article</a> highlighting 100 ideas that you can use while posting on your girlfriend’s Instagram page.</p><p class=align-left>You can go for an interesting comment to impress her.

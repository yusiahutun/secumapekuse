Online part-time work from home jobs are a great way to do it on your own time, without the hassle of a commute or set hours. “Day jobs can be frustrating sometimes, but you may not want to jump ship to a new one because of your current pay or benefits,” says career coach <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mandy Steinhardt</a>, who helps women build careers that fit their values and priorities. “A side gig allows you to create your own schedule and use your free time to build something that’s completely your own.” Steinhardt shares that there’s an online opportunity for women of all backgrounds and skill sets.

Online part-time work from home job: Writing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/2-14.jpg><p>Known for strong writing skills or eagle eye editing? Good news: The demand is incredibly high for freelance writers and editors! Businesses of all kinds need freelancers to create content – in 2022, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">demand for blog writers rose 55.2%</a>.&nbsp; The best part is, you don’t need a degree to start earning — you can easily demonstrate your skills by creating your own writing samples.</p><p>You can find writing and editing gigs on job sites like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indeed</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Freelancer</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Upwork</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiverr</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We Work Remotely</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Contently</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>. There’s a huge variety of projects to choose from, like writing blog posts or social media captions, proofreading corporate reports, editing email newsletters, working on video scripts, creating website copy, etc. You can also reach out to local businesses who might benefit from your content creation services.&nbsp;</p><p>The pay varies depending on the project and factors like word count, the amount of research needed and the deadline (if it’s a quick turnaround, you can expect to charge higher rates). Overall, pay can range from $0.10 per word to $2 per word.</p><p>You can also earn more if you have specialized knowledge or experience in a certain area, so it pays to focus on content that draws from what you know (i.e., educational content if you have teaching experience, healthcare content if your background is in nursing, etc.).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Online part-time work from home job: Voiceover work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/3-11.jpg><p>If you want to get paid to talk, voiceover work might be your dream side gig. Voiceover work entails reading a script and providing a vocal recording, and you don’t need any special experience to get started (just a quiet place, headphones and a microphone).</p><p>There are tons of projects in need of voice actors, including documentaries, commercials, e-learning courses, audiobooks, animations, video games and much more. Plus, with the rise in popularity of video marketing, the demand for this service is continuing to grow. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiverr</a> is a great place for beginners to find clients. It’s free to sign up, and you’re able to set your own rates and keep 80% of what you earn. (Pro tip: Voiceovers are just one of the 200 categories of services you can get paid for on Fiverr)</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Voices</a> is another popular platform that exists to connect freelance voice actors and clients. There are different membership plans, including a free plan that allows voice actors to create a profile, upload demos and receive private invitations for jobs. Another legitimate place to find voiceover work is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snap Recordings</a>, which specializes in telephone greetings.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It worked for me: “I make $70,000 a year doing voice-over work!”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/voiceover.jpg><p>Eleven years ago, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Melissa Epp</a>‘s vocal nerve was severed during a thyroid surgery, and she was told she might not get her voice back. “I had always dreamed of being a voice actress, so as I healed, I became determined to fulfill it! I did speech therapy and vocal exercises, used heating pads and drank lots of water. Not only was my recovery successful, but doing voiceovers is now my full-time vocation,” says Epps.</p><p>“It doesn’t cost a lot to start. All that’s needed is a computer and a mic and audition software, which can be downloaded for free from Adobe. In the beginning, I uploaded a bio and a few projects I had recorded to Fiverr. Potential employers go on the site to hear the recordings, then hire people as a result. I’m now on a few platforms, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Voices.com</a>, which offers both free and paid services.”</p><p>“I get hired to play characters with accents, read children’s books and give voice to animations. I make my own schedule, and now that I have a home studio, I get to work with my goldendoodle by my side. Initially, I earned about $25–$50 for doing small jobs like radio ads for local businesses. But as I gained experience and jobs, my rates increased — so much so that last year I made $70,000! The money I make goes toward the family income, gifts for my kids, husband and dog and donations to local nonprofit arts organizations.” — as told to Alexandra Kay</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Online part-time work from home job: Translating</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/4-10.jpg><p>If you’re bilingual, you can join a community of 21,000+ freelance translators earning extra cash on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gengo</a>. This free-to-use platform has thousands of projects up for grabs in different languages. There’s a particularly high demand for Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish translation services.</p><p>Anyone is welcome to sign up on Gengo, although you have to pass an online test to be approved. According to their website, the average Gengo translator <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">earns $417 per month</a>. With projects available in industries like e-commerce, hospitality, technology, marketing, finance and more, you can take on work you enjoy and learn new things. Translating content is a great way to pad your wallet while staying connected to a language you love — all from the comfort of your home!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Online part-time work from home job: Teaching others</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/5-8.jpg><p>Wouldn’t it be amazing to get paid to share your passions with others online? Thanks to teaching platforms like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Skillshare</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Udemy</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Take Lessons</a>, it’s easier than ever. Even if you’re not tech savvy, these platforms make it easy to record virtual classes and upload them for free. Once you upload your videos, these websites post your videos online to reach students looking to learn the skill you’re teaching. They pay you royalties based on the number of views your videos receive, making it a relatively passive income stream. According to Skillshare, the average teacher earns $3,000 per year — however, there are also teachers who<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> make up to $1,000 per month</a> (you can learn about their strategies on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Skillshare blog</a>).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Online part-time work from home job: Sell your stuff</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/6-7.jpg><p>Got clutter? Not to worry — you can turn it into cash with online platforms that connect you to ready customers in your community. Selling items you no longer need online is a flexible way to make money and clear out your house.</p><p>One easy option is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Marketplace</a> — if you have a Facebook profile, then you’re all set to start earning. It’s free to use, and you set the price and payment method (cash, Venmo, etc.). You can also list just about anything for sale, from electronics to household items. If you’re looking to turn your gently used clothes into cash, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ThredUp</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Poshmark</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercari</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ruby Lane</a> are all trusted platforms. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eBay</a> are also popular options for reselling all sorts of items.</p><p>To take this side gig a step further, you can find items you’re passionate about reselling at garage sales, thrift stores, sample sales, estate sales, discount sales or overseas retailers like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AliExpress</a>. If you find that you’re spending a lot of time listing the same items on multiple sites, you can also take advantage of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">List Perfectly</a> to cross-post on multiple apps. This platform offers multiple membership options (from $29/month to $69/month) and helps make reselling faster, easier and more efficient.</p><p>The amount you can earn varies greatly on how and what you resell. Regardless of the platform you choose, the keys to success are crisp, quality photos and clear descriptions of the items for sale.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>It worked for me: “I make up to $1,000 a month reselling vintage items with List Perfectly!”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/list.jpg><p>In 2018, Kimberly Rose discovered a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching women how to resell items. Inspired to make extra money, she began clearing out her house of items she didn’t need.</p><p>“I signed up for marketplaces like eBay and Poshmark to list the items I wanted to sell. Then, I learned about List Perfectly, a platform that lets sellers cross-post on peer-to-peer marketplaces,” she says. “It struck me as a great way to be more efficient and save time on repetitive listings, so I signed up for the Pro Plan ($69 a month) in January 2021.”</p><p>“Now, I spend about 10 hours per week on this side gig. The bulk of my time is spent preparing items and photographing them. Then I add them to List Perfectly, where I can crosspost unlimited listings on marketplaces like<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Etsy</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grailed</a>, Mercari, eBay, Poshmark, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidizen</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Depop</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tradesy</a> and Thrillin. On average, I earn $800 to $1,000 per month. Some goes toward investing in more inventory from garage sales and thrift stores, and the rest goes into the bank to save for retirement. What I love most is the freedom. I get to name my own hours and sell what I like! Plus, it’s fulfilling to find a new home for something and keep pre-loved items out of the landfills.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Online part-time work from home job: Mystery shopping</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/7-6.jpg><p>Mystery shopping is a fun side gig that involves visiting a business like a regular customer and then filling out an evaluation form to help them find areas for improvement. Thanks to phone mystery shopping gigs, you can get a piece of this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$2 billion industry</a> without having to leave the house!</p><p>So how does it work? Anyone can sign up on sites like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CallCenterQA</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Perception Strategies</a> to learn about upcoming assignments. Phone mystery shopping gigs involve calling call centers or businesses (typically, these phone calls only last a few minutes) and then providing feedback on the customer service experience. While it’s not a get-rich-quick gig, it’s an easy and low-maintenance way to earn extra cash whenever you have spare time at home.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Make Money Being a Mystery Shopper</a></strong></p><p><strong>For more work-from-home jobs, click through the links below!</strong></p><p><a href=#>6 Ways To Make Money Doing Transcription Online From Home—No Experience Needed</a></p><p><a href=#>8 Odd Jobs That Can Score You Cash: Real Women Spill Their Secrets For Success</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJopKimla58sLrLoqWeZaCWv7V506KknmWnpL%2BsecWrpqZlmKS6pnnJqJms</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fonline-part-time-work-from-home-jobs.html&text=Online%20Part%20Time%20Work%20From%20Home%20Jobs%3a%206%20Ways%20to%20Earn&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fonline-part-time-work-from-home-jobs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fonline-part-time-work-from-home-jobs.html&title=Online%20Part%20Time%20Work%20From%20Home%20Jobs%3a%206%20Ways%20to%20Earn" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fonline-part-time-work-from-home-jobs.html&title=Online%20Part%20Time%20Work%20From%20Home%20Jobs%3a%206%20Ways%20to%20Earn" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fonline-part-time-work-from-home-jobs.html&title=Online%20Part%20Time%20Work%20From%20Home%20Jobs%3a%206%20Ways%20to%20Earn" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fonline-part-time-work-from-home-jobs.html&description=Online%20Part%20Time%20Work%20From%20Home%20Jobs%3a%206%20Ways%20to%20Earn" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./vegetable.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tomatoes  smitten kitchen">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./new-age-products-gift-guide.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New-Age Gifts Your Crystal-Obsessed Friends Will Love">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

In a <a href=#>1996 television special</a>, Brooks recalled that the original story was about a married woman whose husband is ignoring her at a party, so she goes off and has an affair with a single guy. Brooks' producer, Allen Reynolds, told him he couldn't root for the characters in the song, and Brooks agreed.</p><p>Driving home from that meeting with his then-wife, he started singing, "She had a need to feel the thunder," and Mahl helped him craft what came to be the final chorus of "That Summer."</p><p>The final lyrics tell the story of a "teenage kid so far from home" who loses his virginity to a "lonely widow woman" he goes to work for one summer.</p><p>"She had a need to feel the thunder / To chase the lightnin' from the sky / To watch a storm with all its wonder / Ragin' in her lover's eyes / She had to ride the heat of passion / Like a comet burnin' bright / Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been / Burning both ends of the night," Brooks sings in the chorus.</p><p>"That Summer" reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart on July 3, 1993, after it was released as the fourth single from Brooks' album, The Chase.</p><p>Brooks filed for divorce from Mahl on Nov. 6, 2000, and he's been married to <a href=#>Trisha Yearwood</a> since December of 2005.</p><p><strong>The Best Protest Songs in Country Music</strong></p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: Remember What Overshadowed Garth's Marriage Proposal?</a><p><strong>Garth Brooks Songs Ranked Worst to First:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJmiqbVurtGopqSrXam1osCMrKympZWnerStzZ2wZqWRnblw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgarth-brooks-that-summer-sandy-mahl.html&text=Remember%20Which%20Garth%20Brooks%20Hit%20He%20Wrote%20With%20His%20Ex-Wife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgarth-brooks-that-summer-sandy-mahl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgarth-brooks-that-summer-sandy-mahl.html&title=Remember%20Which%20Garth%20Brooks%20Hit%20He%20Wrote%20With%20His%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgarth-brooks-that-summer-sandy-mahl.html&title=Remember%20Which%20Garth%20Brooks%20Hit%20He%20Wrote%20With%20His%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgarth-brooks-that-summer-sandy-mahl.html&title=Remember%20Which%20Garth%20Brooks%20Hit%20He%20Wrote%20With%20His%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgarth-brooks-that-summer-sandy-mahl.html&description=Remember%20Which%20Garth%20Brooks%20Hit%20He%20Wrote%20With%20His%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./muslim-men-beards-facial-hair-islam.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The relationship between Muslim men and their beards is a tangled one | Amanullah De Sondy">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kansas-city-weatherman-comes-publicly-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kansas City weatherman comes out on Facebook">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

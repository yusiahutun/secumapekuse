This beloved play, believed to be written around 1601, has captivated audiences for centuries with its delightful blend of mistaken identities, love triangles, and hilarious antics.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-2>The Origins of the Title</h2><p>The title “Twelfth Night” refers to the Christian holiday of Epiphany, which falls on January 6th, marking the end of the Christmas season. In Shakespearean times, this day was associated with festive celebrations and role reversals, which is reflected in the play’s theme of disguises and mistaken identities.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-3>Mistaken Identity Galore</h2><p>One of the prominent features of Twelfth Night is the abundance of mistaken identities. The main character, Viola, disguises herself as a man named Cesario, leading to a series of comical misunderstandings and romantic entanglements.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-4>Shipwrecked!</h2><p>The story of Twelfth Night begins with a shipwreck.

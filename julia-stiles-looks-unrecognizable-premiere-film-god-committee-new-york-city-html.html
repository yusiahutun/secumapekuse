medical movie is set to premiere just over 22 years after the actress first shot to fame while starring in hit movie 10 Things I Hate About You opposite the late Heath Ledger.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the time, the romantic comedy propelled Julia, who was 18 when she shot the film, to the height of Hollywood stardom and turned her into one of the industry's most sought-after leading ladies.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One year after the movie debuted, Julia starred in another rom com, Down to You, alongside on-screen heartthrob Freddie Prinze Jr, before going on to find further big screen success in Save the Last Dance, which also featured&nbsp;Sean Patrick Thomas and Kerry Washington.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, after the success of the dance-focused film, Julia's career as a leading lady dwindled somewhat, and in 2019 she opened up about struggling to find her place in the industry during her 20s.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking to <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Daily Beast</a>, the actress admitted that she felt as though she was 'jumping from job to job that she wasn't really connected to', and she confessed that she was 'worried about where her career was going' for a while.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think a few years ago my frustration was feeling like nobody knew what to do with me,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You know, I had had some success in my twenties and now I’m in a different place in my life and I didn’t really fit anywhere.'&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=#

class=mol-para-with-font>Although Julia worked consistently throughout the 2000s, the roles she was landing were much smaller than the leading characters she had played at the start of her career, and she turned more of her attention to on-stage opportunities in the theater and work behind the camera as a director.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, she was thrown back into the spotlight in 2019 when she was cast in the Jennifer Lopez-led movie Hustlers, in which she played a journalist who interviewed former strippers about their criminal activities.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, The God Committee will see her taking on another leading role, a talented doctor who serves on the heart transplant committee at a New York City hospital.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Julia - who welcomed her first child, son Strummer, with husband Preston J Cook in October 2017 - stars alongside Kelsey Grammer and Janeanne Garofalo in the medical drama,

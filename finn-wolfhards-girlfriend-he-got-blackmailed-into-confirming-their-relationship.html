Just ask Finn Wolfhard’s girlfriend, who may have lost a great lover because of a fan’s actions.&nbsp;</p><p>This particular fan was acting in her favor as the couple had refused to address the topic of their relationship for some time.&nbsp;Meanwhile, they kept getting spotted together in public, looking like an item. Perhaps the suspense was too much for the fan to handle.&nbsp;</p><p>They got hold of Finn Wolfhard’s girlfriend’s address and threatened to release it publicly if he did not go public with what they had.&nbsp;That was the official start of their relationship, but since then, they have become even more private. So much so it’s hard to tell if they are even dating.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep reading to learn all we know about Finn Wolfhard’s girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ifinn-716x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Finn_Wolfhards_Girlfriend></span>Who Is Finn Wolfhard’s Girlfriend?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The woman “Stranger Things” star Finn Wolfhard is currently dating is Elsie Richter.&nbsp;Finn Wolfhard and Elsie Richter initially sparked dating speculations in March 2021 when they were first spotted together.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, they have been spotted together numerous times, looking happy with one another. After some time passed without confirmation from either star, the overzealous fans chose to take matters into their own hands.&nbsp;</p><p>It led Wolfhard to go public with his relationship with Richter. He did so by sharing a since-deleted post that captured him and Richter being adorable with each other.&nbsp;Wolfhard would later reveal that to prevent the toxic fan from exposing Richter’s personal information to the public, he had no choice but to confirm they had something.&nbsp;</p><p>He <a href=#>said</a>: “They’re like, ‘Oh, okay, I’m so sorry. We love her. It all fades once you’re like, ‘Hey, calm down. It’s cool. I’m a real person.’ It’s almost like a trance or something. Maybe it’s a power thing.”&nbsp;</p><p>The ordeal left him with an apathy for social media. Wolfhard added: “I think about deleting Twitter every single day. I don’t even check it anymore.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Elsie_Richter_Still_Finn_Wolfhards_Girlfriend></span>Is Elsie Richter Still Finn Wolfhard’s Girlfriend?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At this point, nobody can say for sure other than those two. Since his run-in with the toxic fan, Wolfhard has become even more private with his personal life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Elsie-Pearls-fotor-20230828143536-1024x652.jpg><p>Since they have finally gone public with their relationship, one would think they would become even more visible publicly and online, but the opposite is happening.&nbsp;Wolfhard and Richter have yet to be forthcoming on information about their relationship. Unlike she used to, Richter no longer posts about Wolfhard, and neither does he put up anything relating to her on his page.&nbsp;</p><p>Their fans suspect the couple may have called it quits and chose to move on. That notion became even more probable when it was noticed Richter was absent for the season 4 premiere of “Stranger Things.”&nbsp;</p><p>The pair have not been <a href=#>spotted</a> in public together in recent times either. Are these enough reasons to believe they are no longer together? Some people seem to think so.&nbsp;</p><p>However, others are content to wait and see where Wolfhard and Richter go with their relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Finn_Wolfhard_and_Millie_Bobby_Brown_Dating></span>Are Finn Wolfhard and Millie Bobby Brown Dating?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Millie Bobby Brown is Wolfhard’s co-star and on-screen love interest in “Stranger Things.” Fans of the show are well aware of the chemistry the two share on set.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bobwn.jpg><p>It is electric and so realistic that it is easy to assume they must also have a relationship off the screen. However, the pair have confessed they are just friends in reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Brown is in a publicized relationship with someone else, and Wolfhard has been known to hang out with them.&nbsp;The actor has praised his friendly bond with Brown for making their work together much easier but has said they are not, and never were, dating.&nbsp;</p><p>Brown said how easy it is to be lovers on screen and then back to friends off the set, “It’s relatively easy, I think. It’s our job. It’s in the scripts, and we feel comfortable with each other, we feel trusted, we’re in a safe environment, so it’s relatively easy.”&nbsp;</p><p>She also added: “I think people hype it up to be awkward, more awkward than it is, but it’s just like your friend, so it’s chill.”</p><p>Despite their statements, fans still have their hopes up as they wait for a Cupid-like miracle to happen while Wolfhard and Brown, with other cast members like <a href=#>Charlie Heaton</a>, work on the fifth season of “Stranger Things.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ks6q6zWauqKSWna6zsNJmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWShnV2cvLV5waWYnKOdlratscNmoKesn2KwsLrFoqmmoZ6cerW0xKKpZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffinn-wolfhards-girlfriend-he-got-blackmailed-into-confirming-their-relationship.html&text=Finn%20Wolfhard%27s%20Girlfriend%3a%20He%20Got%20Blackmailed%20Into%20Confirming%20Their%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffinn-wolfhards-girlfriend-he-got-blackmailed-into-confirming-their-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffinn-wolfhards-girlfriend-he-got-blackmailed-into-confirming-their-relationship.html&title=Finn%20Wolfhard%27s%20Girlfriend%3a%20He%20Got%20Blackmailed%20Into%20Confirming%20Their%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffinn-wolfhards-girlfriend-he-got-blackmailed-into-confirming-their-relationship.html&title=Finn%20Wolfhard%27s%20Girlfriend%3a%20He%20Got%20Blackmailed%20Into%20Confirming%20Their%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffinn-wolfhards-girlfriend-he-got-blackmailed-into-confirming-their-relationship.html&title=Finn%20Wolfhard%27s%20Girlfriend%3a%20He%20Got%20Blackmailed%20Into%20Confirming%20Their%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffinn-wolfhards-girlfriend-he-got-blackmailed-into-confirming-their-relationship.html&description=Finn%20Wolfhard%27s%20Girlfriend%3a%20He%20Got%20Blackmailed%20Into%20Confirming%20Their%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./instagram-notes-number-trend-codes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Instagram Notes Number Trend, Decoded &amp;amp; Explained">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./diy-polka-dot-wrapping-paper.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DIY Polka Dot Gift Paper">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

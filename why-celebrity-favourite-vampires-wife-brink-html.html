At weddings, parties and milestone birthdays, it would be rare not to spot a Falconetti, the brand's most popular style, with its three-quarter length sleeves and ruffled trim.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Since its launch in 2017, the dress has been remade in a dizzying array of fabrics, colours and prints. <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-27532120-1b7f-11ee-b7e1-7381361219ca>Rachel Weisz</a> wore a pale blue floral version for a recent publicity tour. <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-271b9660-1b7f-11ee-b7e1-7381361219ca>Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-27318f60-1b7f-11ee-b7e1-7381361219ca>Keira Knightley</a> both have it in black, while so enamoured is the <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-2750b020-1b7f-11ee-b7e1-7381361219ca>Princess of Wales</a> with the brand that she has the Light Sleeper style in shocking pink and the Falconetti in metallic green. (She even chose to have her portrait painted in it.)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All of which makes The Vampire's Wife's current financial troubles even more surprising.

The Princess of Wales pictured in March, 2022</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On June 30, a petition to wind up the company was presented by HMRC as the result of an unpaid tax bill, plunging its future into uncertainty.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to founder and designer Susie Cave, whose husband is the musician Nick Cave, the petition was issued without warning after a delayed payment earlier this year, with HMRC rejecting the company's request to pay its debt in monthly instalments.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Like many brands, The Vampire's Wife was affected badly by the pandemic, with the firm claiming this is when its debt initially built up.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2021, it made a loss of £2.1 million, but by 2022 it was in profit, with revenue of £5.1 million. Sales for 2023 are expected to reach £6.6 million.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Whilst a court hearing has been set for July 12, 2023, we are working with the company's secured lender to find a solution agreeable to all parties,' it said in a statement, adding that it would continue to trade.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So the beloved frocks are still on sale — but is there a single well-heeled woman left in Britain yet to buy one?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In many ways, The Vampire's Wife has become a victim of its own success. While it would be unfair to say the brand is a one-trick pony, the popularity of its Falconetti could certainly give this impression.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With its flattering length, fitted bodice and dramatic bell sleeves, it seemed to suit almost every age and body type.</p><img id=i-2afc8d3feaf2bc42 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/05/22/72894819-12267703-image-m-156_1688593925982.jpg height=1818 width=634 alt="Presenter Emma Willis pictured in a sparkling deep green gown from The Vampire's Wife in 2018" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Presenter Emma Willis pictured in a sparkling deep green gown from The Vampire's Wife in 2018</p><img id=i-c69175e6a01c587b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/05/22/72894815-12267703-image-a-160_1688593972127.jpg height=834 width=306 alt="Sandra Oh in 2021" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-bbfce1db35ae8dfa src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/05/22/72894821-12267703-image-m-159_1688593953819.jpg height=834 width=306 alt="Rachel Weisz in 2018" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Whether they are 61 or 16, women adore The Vampire's Wife.

According to rental platform, My Wardrobe HQ, The Vampire's Wife is one of the labels that is rented out more than 70 per cent of the time. That customers would rather rent a dress from just £15 a day than commit to buying one suggests concerns about its powers of endurance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So instantly distinctive is the style, that no one, bar the odd thrifty princess, wants to risk being seen in it more than once.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A one-off wear minimises the chances of showing up in the same outfit as another guest, as happened at Prince Harry's wedding in 2018, when three guests, including Sara Parker-Bowles, wore Vampire's Wife dresses, albeit in different colours.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fashion insiders also questioned whether the 2020 collaboration with H&M risked overexposure and damaged sales of its main line, given that an H&M Falconetti-style lace dress was £50. Yet despite its current woes, few would bet against The Vampire's Wife rising again. Susie Cave is a genuine talent and a shrewd businesswoman who has already extended her remit to include jewellery, bags and accessories, including an £85 'Bonfire' scented candle.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It also surely helps that the brand is majority owned by Jimmy Iovine, the billionaire music entrepreneur, and his wife, the model Liberty Ross — though whether they are prepared to invest further in it remains to be seen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Certainly, it's a stark reminder that, for all but the biggest, most powerful players, the fashion industry has never been tougher to survive in. They say vampires live forever; let's hope this namesake label shares their longevity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2Ra21wb2BofJi02GaanqSVl7%2BqwNhmnZqun6q%2FqsDEZo2apaCev6a%2FjJCgn51dl7%2Bquspnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-celebrity-favourite-vampires-wife-brink-html.html&text=Why%20celebrity%20favourite%20The%20Vampire%27s%20Wife%20is%20on%20the%20brink&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-celebrity-favourite-vampires-wife-brink-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-celebrity-favourite-vampires-wife-brink-html.html&title=Why%20celebrity%20favourite%20The%20Vampire%27s%20Wife%20is%20on%20the%20brink" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-celebrity-favourite-vampires-wife-brink-html.html&title=Why%20celebrity%20favourite%20The%20Vampire%27s%20Wife%20is%20on%20the%20brink" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-celebrity-favourite-vampires-wife-brink-html.html&title=Why%20celebrity%20favourite%20The%20Vampire%27s%20Wife%20is%20on%20the%20brink" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-celebrity-favourite-vampires-wife-brink-html.html&description=Why%20celebrity%20favourite%20The%20Vampire%27s%20Wife%20is%20on%20the%20brink" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./article-2cef77be-e8b9-11eb-a171-d73a8c2713e7-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Altus Pittman | Obituaries">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-simpsons-and-rick-and-morty-producer-j-michael-mendel-passes-at-54.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Simpsons and Rick and Morty Producer J.

It was not fun, he said in this week’s issue of Radio Times, as he revealed his experience playing the film’s villain, Russian general Dreykov.</p><p>“Then you find out that a few producers have come down, and your performance is too much, it’s too strong… That’s the way Marvel works,” Winstone said. “It can be soul-destroying because you feel like you’re doing great work.”</p><p>Winstone said that he wanted to give up on the project altogether, but realized he couldn’t. "I actually said, ‘You ought to recast it because that was it for me.’ And you end up doing it again because you’re contracted to do it,” he explained. “Otherwise you end up in court. It’s like being kicked in the balls.” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt="Ray Winstone in Black Widow (IMDb)" title="Ray Winstone in Black Widow (IMDb)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-02/1709207846_untitled-design-2024-02-29t172356-788.jpg></p><p>Winstone admitted in an interview with The Guardian that he sometimes undertakes projects he doesn't feel passionate about due to financial necessity. “You go have fun for six weeks, see how it turns out,” the Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull actor said of the filming process. “If it turns out great, it’s a plus. If it don’t, it don’t. But you’ve had a great six weeks."</p><p>He added, “You do do films you don’t want to do. But you’ve got to do them because you haven’t worked in a little while and you’ve got to pay the rent.” Winstone is set to star in three upcoming projects, including Netflix’s Damsel, A Bit of Light and Guy Ritchie’s series, The Gentlemen.</p><h2 id=65e0c19dea979><strong>Exploring the career of Ray Winstone</strong></h2><p>Raymond Winstone is an English actor with a career spanning five decades.

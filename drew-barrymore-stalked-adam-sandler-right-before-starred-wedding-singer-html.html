It was thanks to her determination that they ever collaborated on a movie. Sandler and all the people who have loved watching them work together are grateful that she didn’t give up.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Adam-Sandler-Drew-Barrymore-.jpg><h2 id=h-have-adam-sandler-and-drew-barrymore-ever-dated>Have Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore ever dated?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_58>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Housekeeping</a>, if you’re looking for an iconic Hollywood couple that has never actually dated, a perfect example is Barrymore and Sandler. Not only are they good friends, but they also seem to have magic chemistry when they work together. They’ve co-starred in three romantic comedies, and from the beginning, their collaboration has boosted both careers.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_78>Barrymore was coming out of a period in her life when drugs and alcohol led her to be <a href=#>blacklisted in Hollywood</a> when she was only 12 years old. Working with Sandler proved that she was still a bankable star. For Sandler, their on-screen romance opened up new doors for him as a romantic lead.&nbsp;“Drew liking me made it seem like girls were allowed to like me in movies,” he explained.&nbsp;And this beautiful friendship all started with one movie.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-movies-have-drew-barrymore-and-adam-sandler-done-together>What movies have Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler done together?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_76>In 1998, Barrymore and Sandler teamed up for their first movie together, the rom-com classic The Wedding Singer. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Things</a>, Barrymore was only 22 years old when she appeared in the movie, while Sandler was 31. But despite their age difference, the two clicked, and audiences loved them.&nbsp;The quirky movie initially wasn’t expected to do very well, but it went on to surprise everyone. It was a blockbuster, bringing in over $123 million globally.</p><p id=par-6_74>Sandler and Barrymore went on to make two more movies together,&nbsp;50 First Dates in 2004, and&nbsp;Blended in 2014. There are rumors that they may reunite for another movie sometime soon.&nbsp;The actors have not only significantly contributed to each other’s careers, but they’ve also become very close friends. <a href=#>Sandler’s wife Jackie</a> reportedly loves Barrymore. But none of this platonic fairy tale would have happened if it weren’t for Barrymore and a determined hunch she had.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-she-admits-that-she-stalked-him>She admits that she ‘stalked’ him</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_56>Barrymore recently recorded a YouTube video for Vanity Fair, in which she outlined the course of her career. She started back when she was just a kid, appearing in&nbsp;E.T.&nbsp;in 1992. She says that director Steven Spielberg was great to work with.&nbsp;When she got to the part where she appeared in&nbsp;The Wedding Singer,&nbsp;she shared a surprising fact.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_63>“I stalked Adam Sandler because I was convinced we were supposed to work together,” she said. “We didn’t look like we should. I had purple hair and a leopard coat. He was dressed like a jock.” Luckily for them both, Barrymore was able to help Sandler see beyond their differences, and they decided to do&nbsp;The Wedding Singer together. And the rest is history.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_68>“All I can say to him is I was right,” Barrymore said. “We have made three films now over the course of 20 years and I love him today as much as ever.” Barrymore’s hunch was clearly spot-on, and her determination paid off in a big way. Not only did she land a huge, successful movie, but she also made a friend who she appreciates to this day.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxs7HWZpmaqqKuurC%2BxGaqrZmcoLKlecCdmKZlo5a7pbjEq2SroZedwW6uxJ%2Bmq51dqMGivtGem2avlZmxqrrGZqqippeav2%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-stalked-adam-sandler-right-before-starred-wedding-singer-html.html&text=Drew%20Barrymore%20%27Stalked%27%20Adam%20Sandler%20Right%20Before%20They%20Starred%20In%20%27The%20Wedding%20Singer%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrew-barrymore-stalked-adam-sandler-right-before-starred-wedding-singer-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-stalked-adam-sandler-right-before-starred-wedding-singer-html.html&title=Drew%20Barrymore%20%27Stalked%27%20Adam%20Sandler%20Right%20Before%20They%20Starred%20In%20%27The%20Wedding%20Singer%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-stalked-adam-sandler-right-before-starred-wedding-singer-html.html&title=Drew%20Barrymore%20%27Stalked%27%20Adam%20Sandler%20Right%20Before%20They%20Starred%20In%20%27The%20Wedding%20Singer%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-stalked-adam-sandler-right-before-starred-wedding-singer-html.html&title=Drew%20Barrymore%20%27Stalked%27%20Adam%20Sandler%20Right%20Before%20They%20Starred%20In%20%27The%20Wedding%20Singer%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrew-barrymore-stalked-adam-sandler-right-before-starred-wedding-singer-html.html&description=Drew%20Barrymore%20%27Stalked%27%20Adam%20Sandler%20Right%20Before%20They%20Starred%20In%20%27The%20Wedding%20Singer%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./goldenvoice-to-bring-panorama-festival-to-new-yorks-randalls-island.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Goldenvoice To Bring Panorama Festival To New York's Randalls Island">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dierks-bentley-gravel-and-gold-tour-dates-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dierks Bentley Plots 2023 'Gravel &amp;amp; Gold' Summer Tour">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

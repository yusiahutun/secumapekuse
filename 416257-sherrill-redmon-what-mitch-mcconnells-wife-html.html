Much is expected from such characters.</p><p class=align-left>Sherrill, Mitch McConnel's first wife, has, indeed, fulfilled these expectations. In addition, she is a strong feminist, creating a profound legacy, significant precedence to many.</p><h2>Who is Sherrill Redmon?</h2><p class=align-left>Sherrill was <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">born in Louisville, Kentucky</a>, to politician parents Charles Redmon and Doris in February 1943.

Here, she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. Sherrill <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">later attended</a> the University of Kentucky and received a Doctor of Philosophy, PhD. in 1974.</p><h2>Sherrill Redmon and Mitch McConnell relationship</h2><p class=align-left>Sherrill Redmon is the first wife of Mitch McConnell. The two met in 1962 when they were studying at the University of Louisville and started dating after half a year. They married in 1968 and had three children: Elly McConnel (1972), Porter McConnel (1976), and Claire McConnell (1979).</p><p class=align-left>Ten years after their marriage, Mitch McConnel became the Judge of Jefferson County, which meant he spent most of his time away from home.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7067527ddde1e676.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Isaak's wife?

This was one year after Clair McConnel’s birth. Mitch McConnel later married Elaine Chao.</p><h2>Life after divorce</h2><p class=align-left>Sherrill was only recognized as a housewife during her marriage, taking care of her children and working at the Archives and Records Centre.</p><p class=align-left>After divorcing McConnel in 1980, Sherrill Redmon became a feminist at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. On top of this, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">later became</a> the Sophia Smith Collection of the Women's History Archives director in 1983.</p><p class=align-left>Mitch McConnell's ex-wife did a fantastic job at the college. She worked hard to grow the Sophia Smith Collection of the Women's History Archives, making it more diverse adopting different <a href=#>cultures</a> and races.</p><p class=align-left>She worked with famous journalist and feminist Gloria Steinem on an oral history project called <i>Voices of Feminism</i>. In an email, the journalist revealed that despite Sherrill's feminist work, she rarely spoke about her relationship with Mitch McConnel.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c8edea257553f549.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Montana Helena Klein Yao: What you should know about Malik Beasley's wife</span></p></a>Despite Sherrill's devotion to recording all of the women's lives, she didn't talk about her earlier part of her own. I can only imagine how painful it must to marry and have children with a democratic Jekyll and see him turn into a corrupt and authoritarian Hyde.<h2>Retirement and legacy</h2><p class=align-left>Sherrill Redmon worked for the Sophia Smith Collection for nineteen years and left on August 31, 2012. She did a fantastic job for the organization and left it transformed and massively improved.</p><p class=align-left>She did her best to address the imbalance in the Collection, which was primarily dominated by the works of white women. Most of these women were from the northeastern United States of America.</p><p class=align-left>Sherrill's improvement in the Sophia Smith Collection allowed underrepresented women to place their works with the organization. Today, these new collections are incredible resources for people from different backgrounds.</p><h2>Sherrill Redmon’s memoir</h2><p class=align-left>Mitch McConnel's ex-wife had made a significant impact on people's lives because of her fantastic work. You are probably looking for Sherrill Redmon's book that accounts for all her life's work, considering her impactful input in society. According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New Yorker website</a>, Sherrill Redmon is working on a tell-all memoir, which, of course, will be something extraordinary.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f77107a3d2287d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lisa Thorner: 5 interesting facts about Damon Wayans' ex-wife</span></p></a><h2>Hobbies and interests</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/32ac453d95372a93.jpg><p class=align-left>Sherrill Redmon has always loved history, mainly of the United States of America.

She is an America native-born in 1985.&nbsp;She was born in Palmer and grew up in the Anchorage area alongside her sister.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As it seems, Rhylee has done her homework when it comes to her profession. She has been actively pursuing her dreams for the last several years with charter fishing vessels located in Alaska. She never steps away from chances that take her close to fishing like competing in local tournaments and exploring different parts of the world as a fishing freelancer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Also, See:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Shep Rose Net Worth, Married, Girlfriend, Gay" rel=follow>Shep Rose Net Worth, Married, Girlfriend, Gay</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Her devotion to her craft led her to M/Y My Seanna, where she experienced her first voyage and the white-glove world of yachting.&nbsp;As for Rhylee's height, she seems to&nbsp;stands with an average stature.</p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Family</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As shared by Rhylee, she always keeps her family above everything else. There was no information about her biological father, but it seems the star was being taken care of by her mother and step-father Lowrey. She has a step-brother and is close to her step-family.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>In 2019, the loving daughter was struck with grief when she learned about her step-father being diagnosed with stage four bone cancer. Even more devastating was the treatment cost required to extend his life. Gerber required a total of $22,000 per treatment for the life-prolonging process. Despite this, the deckhand is trying hard to accumulate as much as possible. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Got Arrested?</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The loyal and hardworking fishing geek got herself in trouble in January of 2018. The shocking news came to the public eyes after RadarOnline did some digging on the Below Deck participant’s history.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Rhylee got arrested on the 23rd of January 2019 for trespassing on private property. She was appointed a lawyer but was unable to pay the expenses related to her legal services. In numbers, the maximum penalty one can get charged on trespassing is $500 and six months behind bars.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Luckily, Gerber minimized her penalty to a decision-making class and 12 hours of community service. The reality star also wrote an apology letter to the witness. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Dating, Boyfriend, Married?</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Rhylee was in a relationship before her entry in the Below Deck crew in Season six. It seems she was engaged to someone but did not reveal his&nbsp;name. She opened up about her ex-fiancé&nbsp;on the show Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen&nbsp;in December of 2018.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>She commented that she was serious about the relationship. They had met in Florida and got engaged. They eventually split up due to career misunderstandings.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-711 data-method=ai-placeholders class=ezoic-autoinsert-ad></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As for now, it looks like Rhylee is in a relationship with her Below Deck fellow crewmate Tyler Rowland. Their dating life is not confirmed, but their Instagram selfies with captions like 'summer love' indicate otherwise.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Never Miss:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jazmin Lang Wiki, Bio, Married, Husband, Parents" rel=follow>Jazmin Lang Wiki, Bio, Married, Husband, Parents</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><img alt height=553 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikinetworth.com/uploads/Rhylee-Tyler-snip.JPG width=450 ezimgfmt="rs rscb2 src ng ngcb2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Rhylee with her crewmate Tyler (Photo: Tyler’s Instagram)</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>However, both of them have not publicly accepted their relationship.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The two did go on a date though. Fans got bummed when Tyler mentioned that he did not share the same feelings as Rhylee. He stated that he just wanted to know her better. In response, Rhylee felt kind of sad and even shed some tears in her Below Deck interview. Tyler later apologized via Twitter for the misunderstanding he had created and added that Rhylee deserved better.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As for us fans, we wish our beloved star gets married to the husband that best suits her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-710 data-method=ai-placeholders class=ezoic-autoinsert-ad></span><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Net Worth</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Bravo’s Below Deck crew members take home a lot more than their average salary. The collective tips can be peak up to $30,000. A single season can accumulate around $168,000 just from tips.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>You Will Also Enjoy:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Olivia Pierson Wiki, Bio, Age, Model, Boyfriend, Dating or Lesbian" rel=follow>Olivia Pierson Wiki, Bio, Age, Model, Boyfriend, Dating or Lesbian</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As a deckhand, Rhylee is estimated to make anywhere from $40,000 to $55,000 annually.</p><h2 dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Now</h2><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The famous deckhand Rhylee&nbsp;got caught in a social media shaming with her controversial post. In 2019, she shared a picture of a caribou she hunted in Alaska. But things went a bit curvy when she hashtagged vegans in her post. Adding to that, she also argued with the fans who were uncomfortable with the image.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The fire had not settled down when news about her being involved in canned hunting enveloped the social media. The reason for accusation is unclear, though.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2r7HTsKarrJhjsLC5jpycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZqugqaGypnnGnqmbnaJixKq3yGakmqqinrKlecWapKKkqWO1tbnL</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frhylee-gerber-wiki-married-family-html.html&text=Rhylee%20Gerber%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhylee-gerber-wiki-married-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhylee-gerber-wiki-married-family-html.html&title=Rhylee%20Gerber%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frhylee-gerber-wiki-married-family-html.html&title=Rhylee%20Gerber%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frhylee-gerber-wiki-married-family-html.html&title=Rhylee%20Gerber%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhylee-gerber-wiki-married-family-html.html&description=Rhylee%20Gerber%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./today-savannah-guthrie-51-wows-tiny-crop-top-photo-makes-hoda-kotb-envious.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Savannah Guthrie stuns in crop top in photo that makes co-star Hoda Kotb envious">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./died-on-april-2017-charlie-murphy-was-married-to-tisha-taylor-has-three-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Comedian Charlie Murphy And Wife Tisha Taylor Both Lost Leukemia battle-See Journey Of The Couple">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

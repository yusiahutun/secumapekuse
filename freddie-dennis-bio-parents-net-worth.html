The channel gained rapid success with its series of short sketches depicting the humorous aspects of the quintessential Canadian farmer and associated challenges, collectively known as&nbsp;Letterkenny Problems.</p><p>This online success served as the foundation for the 2016 sitcom&nbsp;Letterkenny, set and shot in Sudbury, Ontario, accumulating over 100 million views as of January 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, in 2014, he starred in Heritage Minutes, focusing on the Winnipeg Falcons, a team of Icelandic-Canadian hockey players who not only served in the First World War but also secured Canada’s first Olympic gold medal in hockey.&nbsp;</p><p>Building on the cult success of&nbsp;Letterkenny, Keeso ventured into creating a spin-off series, Shoresy, in 2022, centering around the character Shoresy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Notably, Keeso portrayed Ben Chartier in the 2014 English-language adaptation of&nbsp;19-2, earning him a Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, he took on diverse roles in films, such as Nicholas in&nbsp;Smokin’ Aces 2: Assassins’ Ball, Adam in the high-school-themed Lifetime original movie&nbsp;Seven Deadly Sins, and Simon in the drug-themed&nbsp;Charlie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Jared Keeso missing a tooth?</h2><p>Since its premiere in 2016, the Canadian hit series&nbsp;Letterkenny&nbsp;has garnered immense popularity for its humorous portrayal of rural life, filled with puns, wordplay, and hilarious vignettes.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, Keeso, the creator and star of&nbsp;Letterkenny, introduced the spinoff&nbsp;Shoresy, centered around his beloved yet only partially-seen hockey player from the original series.&nbsp;</p><p>Shoresy, known for his lightning-fast retorts delivered in falsetto with his face obscured, takes center stage in his own series, showcasing a devilish smirk with a missing tooth.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The missing tooth became a subject of debate among fans on Reddit, where discussions revolved around whether Keeso wore makeup or was fully committed to the portrayal.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Canada Media Fund</a>, Keeso had the tooth surgically removed to ensure authenticity.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Exploring Jared Keeso’s early life</h2><p>Keeso was born on July 1, 1984, in Listowel, Ontario, to his parents, Anne and Richard Keeso. His family owned and operated The Keeso Sawmill Company.&nbsp;</p><p>In his youth, Keeso actively engaged in the family business, spending several years working at the sawmill. However, a significant turning point occurred on September 9, 2018, when a devastating fire destroyed the sawmill.</p><p>Despite this setback, Keeso, like many boys in the closely-knit community, discovered his passion on the hockey rink.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The actor pursued a career in junior hockey, playing for the Strathroy Rockets in the WOHL, where he shared the ice with future two-time Stanley Cup champion Jeff Carter. Additionally, his hockey journey led him to the Listowel Cyclones of the GOJHL.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Jared Keeso have any tattoos?</h2><p>On his right bicep, Keeso proudly displays a ‘J.H. KEESO’ tattoo, an homage to the Sawmill company owned and operated by his father.</p><p>The J.H. KEESO business has a rich history, dating back to its founding in 1872 by Keeso’s ancestors, making the tattoo a symbol of familial legacy.&nbsp;Before embarking on his successful acting career, the actor spent a considerable portion of his life working in the mill.&nbsp;</p><p>On his left bicep, Keeso sports a tattoo of his dog. The&nbsp;Letterkenny&nbsp;actor’s love for his friend is evident as fans have witnessed them on walks and in markets. To immortalize this companionship, Keeso chose to ink his dog’s portrait on his skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, amidst his collection of meaningful tattoos, Keeso also sports several random lines and word tattoos that may seem enigmatic to outsiders. While these may not have an obvious meaning for onlookers, they likely hold personal significance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpfm7%2BmsMOinGaclaO7qr%2BMm6CoZaCWv6a606xkp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffreddie-dennis-bio-parents-net-worth.html&text=His%20Bio%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20More&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffreddie-dennis-bio-parents-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffreddie-dennis-bio-parents-net-worth.html&title=His%20Bio%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffreddie-dennis-bio-parents-net-worth.html&title=His%20Bio%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20More" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffreddie-dennis-bio-parents-net-worth.html&title=His%20Bio%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20More" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffreddie-dennis-bio-parents-net-worth.html&description=His%20Bio%2c%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./madison-pettis-flaunts-her-amazing-figure-in-bikini-find-out-who-is-her-boyfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Actress Madison Pettis dating someone?

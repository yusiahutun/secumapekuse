However, last week, he posted a series of photos and videos detailing what he was up to. The <a href=#>TV</a> star’s death has devastated fans across the world, with many choosing to go back and re-watch one of the most successful sitcoms of all time. Although, the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s posts in his final days has caused concern for his followers.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matthew-perry-s-final-post-no-need-to-worry>Matthew Perry’s final post – ‘No need to worry’</h2><p>The star was clearly enjoying one of his loves – <a href=#>movies</a>. Matthew shared several clips and photos revolved around the DC character Batman, and jumped into the role jokingly for his social media profile.</p><p>On October 17, he wrote: “No need to worry everybody, I’ve got the streets tonight.”</p><p>The 54-year-old shared a clip of the poster art for the latest DC flick of the superhero. He panned the camera to show lights in the ceiling, mirroring stars, as well as a batman signal.</p><p>In follow-up updates, he was still playful. He then wrote he has the “city tonight” and referred to himself as Mattman, a play on Bruce Wayne’s alter ego.</p><p>Then the 17 Again actor displayed an announcement board, again in an outline of Batman, and said “Rest easy. I’m on a tall building”. Matthew also joked he had three cranberries to eat that whole day, before sharing carved pumpkins for the holiday season.</p><p>In the star’s final upload, he was in a hot tub or pool under the night sky.</p><p>Matthew tragically died suddenly on Saturday (October 28), at his Los Angeles home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matthew-brought-so-much-joy-to-the-world>‘Matthew brought so much joy to the world’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1132315-1024x671.jpg><p>The American-Canadian star died in an apparent drowning in his hot tub, reports have said. Initial postmortem reports are ‘inconclusive’, <a href=# rel=nofollow>writes</a> The Independent.</p><p>The actor’s cause of death remains unclear and further investigations are underway, it’s understood. Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s office said the official cause of death is unlikely to be declared for a matter of weeks.</p><p>Matthew’s family released a statement to People following his devastating death.</p><p>They said: “Matthew brought so much joy to the world, both as an actor and a friend. You all meant so much to him and we appreciate the tremendous outpouring of love.”</p><p>His passing also comes almost one year to the day following the release of his honest memoir. Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing released on November 1, 2022. In his book, Matthew opened up over his relationship with <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a>, his substance use while filming the show and how he survived a near-death experience four years ago. At the time, his colon burst following opioid overuse and spent two weeks in a coma. Matthew’s family at the time were told he only had a “2% chance” of living through the ordeal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-haven-t-been-able-to-think-about-anything-else-since>Fans ‘haven’t been able to think about anything else since’</h2><p>The news has caused a ripple around the globe, with tributes pouring in from fans.</p><p>One wrote: “I fell asleep watching Friends on Friday night but couldn’t sleep through.</p><p>“Was up and down all night, always having Friends on in the background. Finally got to sleep at 4am and woke up at 10am (UK time) and saw this terrible news.</p><p>“Haven’t been able to think about anything else since. I’m absolutely heartbroken. Tried to watch Friends because it’s my go-to show, especially when I’m feeling down, but it’s not the same anymore. I found it eerie and weird.

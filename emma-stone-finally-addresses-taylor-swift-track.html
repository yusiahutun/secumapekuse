After the sale of her back catalog, Taylor re-recorded them so she would own the masters. With each album, she has added new songs or ‘vault tracks’ that were written for the original albums but were not included. Fans think that one of them, When Emma Falls in Love, is about the <a href=#>movie</a> star.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-104074609-866x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-speculate-taylor-swift-track-is-about-emma-stone>Fans speculate Taylor Swift track is about Emma Stone</h2><p>When the track was released, fans theorized it might be about Emma, who the <a href=#>music</a> star was good friends with during the time of writing and recording of the original album.</p><p>On Reddit, some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">agreed</a> it was the actress, 35. One said: “I have zero real information, but I saw an Insta post which linked it to Emma Stone, who Taylor was/is friends with.”</p><p>Another said: “Literally no way of knowing. And even then we might not find out. Some are guessing that it might be about Emma Stone. But no one really knows.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s ‘first date’ rule she didn’t break for Travis Kelce</a></p><p>However, others have suggested it could have been completely fictional and may be a reference to Jane Austen’s novel and character, Emma.</p><p>“I believe it’s a reference to Jane Austen’s character Emma. In the novel, one of the characters says something along the lines of ‘I should like to see Emma in love,'” wrote one person.</p><p>Another said: “There’s two general thoughts regarding who she is. If she’s real, then Emma Stone makes a lot of sense, they were very close back when she was writing ‘Speak Now.’ If she’s fictional, then the prevailing thought is it’s based off of the novel ‘Emma’ from Jane Austen.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emma-gets-flustered-when-asked-about-the-track>Emma gets flustered when asked about the track</h2><p>While on the red carpet for the premiere of the new film Poor Things (of which both Taylor and Emma attended), the <a href=#>celebrity</a> was asked about the prospect that she could be the Emma that the 33-year-old sings about.</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star seemed taken aback by the question and replied: “Oh.” After a pause, she said: “You would have to ask her.”</p><p>Taylor did confirm during one of Eras Tour shows it was about a “close friend” so it looks likely that the song is about Emma.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emma-had-dated-andrew-garfield>Emma had dated Andrew Garfield</h2><p>Before the release of the vault track, Emma dated her Spider-Man co-star Andrew Garfield from 2011 until 2015. Andrew spoke very fondly of his then-girlfriend. He famously called her a “shot of espresso.”</p><p>He said: “She’s like being bathed in the sunlight. She’s incredibly energetic and enthusiastic and she had this sense of play and fun which was incredibly exciting.”</p><p>The pair dated for two years and when they broke up, Emma addressed it without actually addressing it.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “See, I never talk about this stuff for this exact reason — because it’s all so speculative and baseless. Once you start responding — once you’re like, ‘No, that’s not true’— then they’re like, ‘Well, if we push enough, we’ll get a comment, so let’s see what else we can make up.’</p><p>“I understand the interest in it completely, because I’ve had it, too. But it’s so special to me that it never feels good to talk about, so I just continually don’t talk about it.”</p><p>Emma is now married to Dave McCary, whom she wed in 2020. They have a daughter, Louise, who was born in 2021. As for Andrew, he is seemingly single right now after separating from model Alyssa Miller last year.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Inside Taylor Swift’s year from hell – Not going outside and afraid of phone calls</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WFcLHMpphmq6Sku6Z5xaKlmqScrnqisMOrnKyrlah6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjK2pmpubZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2femma-stone-finally-addresses-taylor-swift-track.html&text=Emma%20Stone%20flustered%20as%20she%27s%20put%20on%20the%20spot%20about%20Taylor%20Swift%20song%20%27about%20her%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2femma-stone-finally-addresses-taylor-swift-track.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2femma-stone-finally-addresses-taylor-swift-track.html&title=Emma%20Stone%20flustered%20as%20she%27s%20put%20on%20the%20spot%20about%20Taylor%20Swift%20song%20%27about%20her%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2femma-stone-finally-addresses-taylor-swift-track.html&title=Emma%20Stone%20flustered%20as%20she%27s%20put%20on%20the%20spot%20about%20Taylor%20Swift%20song%20%27about%20her%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2femma-stone-finally-addresses-taylor-swift-track.html&title=Emma%20Stone%20flustered%20as%20she%27s%20put%20on%20the%20spot%20about%20Taylor%20Swift%20song%20%27about%20her%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2femma-stone-finally-addresses-taylor-swift-track.html&description=Emma%20Stone%20flustered%20as%20she%27s%20put%20on%20the%20spot%20about%20Taylor%20Swift%20song%20%27about%20her%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-middleton-sparkly-headpiece-trend-summer-2023-7497897.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Middleton Single-Handedly Made Sparkly Headbands an It Accessory">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./19-astounding-facts-about-corin-nemec.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="19 Astounding Facts About Corin Nemec">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

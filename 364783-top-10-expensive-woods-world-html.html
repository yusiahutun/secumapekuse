This can range from furniture, firewood, toothpicks to paper. Everyone can tell that there are many different types of wood and because there are trees almost everywhere, it is easy to be misled into thinking that wood is cheap. Yes, wood is generally not an expensive material, but some types are quite costly. The value will depend on several aspects and given that some of the types of wood are very rare, it makes sense that it will cost a fortune to purchase them.

The price of timber, for instance, may vary based on its strength, attractive aesthetic or just its rarity. As a result, you may need some expert knowledge of the most expensive woods in the world before you buy wood or its products. With no experience, you can easily get reaped off by being sold cheap wood and made to believe that it is expensive.

Bocote - $32.99/board feet</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b3780b168bf2d668.jpeg><p class=align-left>The Bocote, belonging to the Cordia, is the most expensive wood. Cordia is a rare type of flowering plant that is part of the borage family. Cordia makes up to around 300 classes of the shrubs and trees. These shrubs and trees can be found anywhere on the globe but are most common in the hotter regions of the earth.</p><p class=align-left>The Bocote can be used in many ways because of its incredible grain and attractive appearance. It is widely used in furniture, musical instruments, gunstocks, boats and small turned objects among many other uses.</p><h3>2. Bubinga - $18.99/board feet</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4864dc74cbb496d0.jpg><p class=align-left>Bubinga is yet another species of a flower-bearing plant belonging to the Guibourtia group. This species is common in swampy areas but can also be found in some flooded forests. The Bubinga trees mostly grow near river banks or lake coasts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2d2254d7a23104bf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 most expensive fruits in the world and prices in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One of the notable advantages of this wood is the wide range of colour variation available. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bubinga trees are large</a>, and this means the wood can produce large slabs for making tabletops and other uses such as turnings, veneer and beautiful furniture. The wood is hard and lasts long without cracking or warping.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>10 most visited countries in Africa</p><h3>3. Dalbergia - $14-16/board feet</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8b3ff87756387e5d.png><p class=align-left>Dalbergia plant is part of the genus Albertina. Albertina is commonly identified as a great genus, and it ranges from small-sized to medium trees. It also forms part of the shrubs and pea family known as the Barefaced. This genus is extensively distributed in tropical areas of the Central and South America, Africa, Madagascar and South of Asia.</p><p class=align-left>Dalbergia wood is preferred to Brazilian Rosewood when it comes to making acoustic guitars. The wood is quite beautiful and can also be used in fine furniture and flooring. Dalbergia is one of the most expensive timbers in the world because of the tough terrain in which it is found.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a1787c9d8c2c39de.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 of the most expensive suits ever made</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Top 10 highest bridges in the US 2020</p><h3>4.

The wood comes in different widths hence providing with enough wood for perfect furniture finishing. Purple Heart is well surfaced, and its dull colour contributes to its aesthetics. As this wood ages, it continues to change its colour and eventually becomes dark-brown with only a few traces of purple.</p><p class=align-left>This can be prevented by using a finish on the wood to inhibit UV light. Purple Heartwood is suitable for heavy construction, furniture, flooring, and boatbuilding, among other uses. Its advantages include beauty, strength and the fact that it is water-resistant. It is one of the most expensive wood flooring products.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>10 most dangerous jungles in the world</p><h3>5.

What did I enjoy? What do I want to improve on? What are some things — skills, products — I acquired that really improved my life? While the other questions might take me some more time to answer, the latter one is very simple — and I’m about to spill all the things that majorly leveled-up my life this season.

Why? Because summer is the time I wear the most complicated tank tops that usually call for strapless bras. But alas, I can’t change that now; all I can say is that I’m so happy I finally found *the* one because let me tell you, finding a good strapless bra is truly a journey. Some slip! Others poke! But the second I put this Spanx find on, I knew my search had ended. It’s made with the brand’s innovative Spanx SmartGrip technology that ensures it stays put, even if you’re running to catch the subway and make it in the door one second before it closes (yes, it’s happened to me). It comes with removable straps, too, so you can wear it as a regular bra, plus it has the perfect amount of padding that gives a nice shape without feeling overwhelming.

That’s because when something is as good as this midi, it simply can’t be talked about enough.

The quality is unreal for the price — it has the perfect weight, and the satin-y fabric looks so luxe, though it washes incredibly easily, unlike some silk pieces that you have to be really careful with. I’ve worn mine with everything from sneakers to heels, and as the temperature gets cooler, I’ll swap the heels for ankle boots.

I did a lot of research and was between a few frames on Amazon, but ultimately, I felt like getting a top-quality one was the best choice.

I’d read so much about it, and the internet was truly wild for it, and now, so am I. I kid you not — it took all but 10 minutes to put together (by myself, mind you!). The instructions are so clear, and the design, based on Japanese joinery, is a game-changer. I didn't need any tools — save for some man power — and the look is *chef’s kiss.* Super simple, super clean, and very minimalist, just how I like it. You can best bet I told my mom, who’s also looking for a new frame, that this one is it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vegamour-hydr-8-deep-moisture-repair-mask></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Vegamour Hydr-8 Deep Moisture Repair Mask</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vegamour</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My hair was in serious need of some love.

And let me tell you, it saved my hair — that’s not an understatement. After showering, I applied a small amount of the cream to my wet locks (a little goes a long way, so just be mindful of that), kept it on for 10 minutes, rinsed it off, and then let my hair air dry. The result was shiny, hydrated, frizz-free hair that looked and felt stronger and healthier. Even a week later, my hair still looked good, but I’ll definitely be incorporating this into my routine bi-weekly — with winter coming, my hair is definitely going to dry out again.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scarlett-chase-portia-75-stretch-bootie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scarlett Chase Portia 75 Stretch Bootie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Scarlett Chase</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s something I never thought I would say: I found a pair of heeled booties that feel like sneakers. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Scarlett Chase's sock booties</a> are incredibly stunning to look at (and trust me, I’m über picky about my boot silhouettes), but feel like my trusty sneakers. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The brand's shoes</a> are currently still under-the-radar, but will blow up soon (mark my words), because when a shoe is that pretty and comfortable, it’s bound for big things.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sock booties are designed with arch support, plus a heel that actually feels stable.

I can easily do my makeup (including a killer winged liner), but there’s one beauty skill I simply have never nailed down — until now, that is. Curling my hair has always been a challenge for me, and I guess it was simply because I hadn’t found the right curler for me. I have thin, fine hair, so I’m also incredibly careful about the heat that I use on it — and TBH, I limit any sort of hot tools. But when I recently tried <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the Shark FlexStyle</a>, which is basically six hair tools in one, it was love at first curl, literally. I instantly fell in love with the curling wand aspect; it’s so easy to use that anyone, even someone who can’t do their hair (like me!), can feel like a hair pro. It automatically wraps and curls, resulting in the perfect waves in just seconds. So easy, and honestly, fun. Ever since I added one to my beauty lineup, I’ve used it whenever I have a few minutes to zhush up my hair.&nbsp; It’s really a must-have for thin hair — pinky promise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6uZp2UnsGwvoyap6mqn6uypXnPq6adrZOpwG6%2F1KaknqpdZ31zf4xwb25rYWWC</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnew-editor-approved-products-summer-2023-7853105.html&text=Ive%20Tried%20Countless%20New%20Items%2c%20but%20These%20Are%20the%208%20Best&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnew-editor-approved-products-summer-2023-7853105.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnew-editor-approved-products-summer-2023-7853105.html&title=Ive%20Tried%20Countless%20New%20Items%2c%20but%20These%20Are%20the%208%20Best" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnew-editor-approved-products-summer-2023-7853105.html&title=Ive%20Tried%20Countless%20New%20Items%2c%20but%20These%20Are%20the%208%20Best" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnew-editor-approved-products-summer-2023-7853105.html&title=Ive%20Tried%20Countless%20New%20Items%2c%20but%20These%20Are%20the%208%20Best" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnew-editor-approved-products-summer-2023-7853105.html&description=Ive%20Tried%20Countless%20New%20Items%2c%20but%20These%20Are%20the%208%20Best" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./37-facts-about-chelsea-peretti.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="37 Facts About Chelsea Peretti">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./breaking-children-hospitalised-after-bus-30993728.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Children rushed to hospital after bus roof ripped off in horror crash">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

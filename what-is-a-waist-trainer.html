However, are waist trainers effective, and what are the risks of using one?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We turned to a slew of experts who let us in on everything you need to know about the controversial trend.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-a-waist-trainer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is a Waist Trainer?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A waist trainer is a device similar to a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>corset</a>, typically manufactured from an elastic material," explained Kelley Vargo, MS, MPH, CSCS, a certified strength and conditioning coach. Often, waist trainers feature a velcro strap that can be cinched around the waist or a bra-style hook and eyes that can be progressively tightened. The intention behind wearing one?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"To create a slimmer waist and an hourglass figure," Vargo said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The idea of using a garment to shape the waist is nothing new.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's a historical aspect to waist training that goes back to the 1500s," said Jaclyn Fulop, a board-licensed physical therapist and founder of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Exchange Physical Therapy Group</a>. "Women would tighten corsets over a period of time to achieve a smaller waist size."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Waist trainers these days are made of different materials and not usually worn as tightly, but they promise a similar effect.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They claim to tone, slim, and shape the waistline — taking inches off the belly," Fulop said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-waist-trainers-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Waist Trainers Work</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Waist trainers may deliver on some of their promises.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There may be some water weight shed through sweating from wearing a waist trainer," Vargo said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, it's important to note that losing water weight doesn't mean you've lost fat. Waist trainers&nbsp;do&nbsp;sort of help change the shape of your body. Tightly cinched waist trainers make it hard to use your abdominal muscles, which can make them weaker. This could make your waist appear slimmer over time since the muscles become smaller.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If your waist appears to be smaller after a few weeks, it's likely due to water loss and muscle atrophy," Vargo said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your waist will appear smaller while wearing the waist trainer since it works similarly to shapewear. Once you take it off, though, you may notice less of a difference in your waistline.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are also some indirect ways a waist trainer may make your waist appear smaller.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A waist trainer can have some short-term benefits, like improving posture, as it forces you to sit and stand up straight," Fulop pointed out. That might provide an overall "longer" appearance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A waist trainer can also encourage proper lifting technique [with weights or heavy objects] due to its rigid nature," Fulop said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And better form could mean better fitness.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-side-effects-of-using-a-waist-trainer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Side Effects of Using a Waist Trainer</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The thing about waist trainers is that while they may have a few short-term benefits, the cons definitely outweigh the pros.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>They prevent you from strengthening your core.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, as mentioned earlier, wearing a waist trainer during exercise or in everyday life can make your core muscles weaker.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If worn too much, the core muscles will start to depend on the stability and support of the waist trainer," Fulop said</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brooke Cates, a prenatal and postnatal exercise specialist and founder of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Bloom Method</a>, added, "Waist trainers can become a crutch due to over-wearing and not simultaneously training the core appropriately. If a person isn't implementing proper core and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>pelvic floor training</a>&nbsp;and just hoping that the waist trainer will magically slim their waist, they will be highly disappointed."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Waist trainers mess with your breathing.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They've been shown to inhibit your ability to breathe deeply,<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span> Vargo pointed out. So wearing one might help your weightlifting form a little bit, but it may also mess with your exercise performance. It should go without saying; however, as a reminder, how hard you work out is directly tied to your ability to breathe. This is why weightlifters who use lifting belts — which act similarly to waist trainers in supporting core muscles — loosen them right after performing a lift. What's more, reduced lung capacity can lead to fatigue or even loss of consciousness (i.e. fainting), suggested Fulop.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>They can shift your organs and cause long-term health issues.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If worn for a very long time, waist trainers can also have the same negative structural effects as corsets. Mainly, wearing a waist trainer can shift the floating ribs or the ribs that aren't attached to your sternum. This may move internal organs, causing the upper organs in the area to move further up and the lower organs to move further down, noted Fulop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a result, long-term waist training can also cause digestive issues, a decrease in circulation, rib damage, and a condition called costochondritis, which is inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>They can cause pelvic floor issues, especially in women who have recently given birth.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Brooke Cavalla</a>, a certified personal trainer, never considered wearing a waist trainer until after the birth of her second baby. It was a rough delivery, and her core felt super weak afterward. She revealed that she started wearing a waist trainer because she wanted extra support, and the idea of shrinking her stomach and uterus was appealing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"About three weeks after my second baby was born, I started feeling a very strange 'bulging' in my pelvic area," Cavalla recalled. "Because this was my second baby and I have a background as a prenatal/postnatal exercise specialist, I knew what I was feeling could not be normal." After consulting with her OB, she found out she had a slight bladder prolapse, which meant her bladder was pushing against the wall of her vagina.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Because my pelvic floor was already weak from a large baby and an aggressive delivery, wearing a waist trainer had placed even more pressure on my pelvic floor and caused a grade 1 prolapse," Cavalla explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, Cavalla's experience isn't that rare among women who wear waist trainers after birth.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Waist trainers can often be quite aggressive for the postpartum core (or any core for that matter), and even the more gentle ones can cause issues if not used correctly," Cates said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In the early days postpartum, the internal organs, uterus, and pelvic floor musculature are moving through a massive healing state and require the ability to move back into their pre-pregnancy spaces," Cates explained.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some external support can help with this, but most of the time, something more gentle is appropriate, like high-waisted compression panties.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Strapping on a waistband, sucking in your belly, and tightening an external object around your torso can sometimes do more harm than good," Cates added.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-final-takeaway></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Final Takeaway</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Experts agree: The best way to shape your waist is through diet and exercise.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Processed, sugar-laden foods, drinking your calories, and calorically-dense foods should be minimized," Vargo said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of exercise, she recommended&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>core strengthening exercises</a>&nbsp;combined with metabolic conditioning (like HIIT workouts). Vargo also suggested keeping track of your waist measurement while you make these changes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Remember: Slow and steady progress is lasting progress," she noted before adding, "Last but not least, if something sounds too good to be true, it is. Stay committed to the journey, and you will see results."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWmrcutn2aemam7pr%2FSaK6hmaRitrR5wGaumqGjqXq1vsCipZ6q</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-a-waist-trainer.html&text=What%20Is%20a%20Waist%20Trainer%20%20and%20Do%20They%20Work%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-a-waist-trainer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-a-waist-trainer.html&title=What%20Is%20a%20Waist%20Trainer%20%20and%20Do%20They%20Work%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-a-waist-trainer.html&title=What%20Is%20a%20Waist%20Trainer%20%20and%20Do%20They%20Work%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-a-waist-trainer.html&title=What%20Is%20a%20Waist%20Trainer%20%20and%20Do%20They%20Work%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-a-waist-trainer.html&description=What%20Is%20a%20Waist%20Trainer%20%20and%20Do%20They%20Work%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bobby-brown-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Bobby Brown Now?

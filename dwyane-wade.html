His parents are <strong><a href=#>Dwyane Wade</a> Sr.</strong> and <strong>Jolinda Wade</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The basketballer’s parents divorced when he was very young. After that, his mother got custody of him and his sister Tragil.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she was not stable enough to raise kids on her own. Jolinda had drug problems and was in and out of prison constantly.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, his sister Trail tricked him into moving in with their father, <a href=#>Dwyane Wade</a> Sr., and his family.</p><p>She told the NBA player that they were going to the movies but instead took him to their father’s place.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dwyane-Wade-Father.jpg><p>D-Wade is grateful to his sister for making that move and credits Trail for always putting him on the right track.</p><p>In an interview, the basketballer mentioned that he would’ve probably ended up in gangs doing drugs if he hadn’t moved in with his father.&nbsp;</p><p>As expected, Wade Sr. was strict, so he prevented his children from hanging out with the wrong crowd. He used to work in a printing plant and coach basketball at Blue Island Recreational Center.</p><p>Moreover, he used to hoop in his early days and wanted his children to catch on a hobby. So, he took young Dwyane to the recreational center along with his stepbrother Demetris.&nbsp;</p><p>They used to play basketball together and were coached by Wade Senior. Slowly, The Flash’s love and passion for the game grew, and he started developing outstanding skills.&nbsp;</p><p>During the shooting guard’s professional career, his mother started turning things around for herself.</p><p>She quit drugs and has been drug-free since 2003 and became a Baptist pastor. After that, Wade gifted a church to his mother, who thought of buying it herself through loans.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Initially, Wade studied in a local school in Chicago. However, when his father moved to&nbsp; Robins, he had to switch schools.&nbsp;</p><p>The player attended Harold L. Richards High School, where he played high school basketball. Since his grades weren’t that great, Wade didn’t get any scholarship offers based on his skills alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Marquette University was not ready to give up on the player and recognized his potential. Hence, they gave him a chance to study at their college and play for the Marquette Golden Eagles.&nbsp;</p><p>You Might Be Interested In Former Heat’s Point Guard:<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>&lt;&lt;Rafer Alston Bio: Net Worth, Stats, Contract, Jersey & NBA >></a></strong></p><p>The former NBA player was born on January 17, 1982. Hence, he is 41 years old as of 2023. Being an athlete, he takes great care of his health and diet.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, he is quite fit and has a very toned physique. Furthermore, Dwayne is 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 220 lb, i.e., 100 kg.</p><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Wade went to Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn for his high school. Further, here he played both basketball and football for the High school team.</p><p>After growing four inches by the start of his junior year, he got more into basketball. As a result, he emerged as the team leader, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game.</p><p>Furthermore, his improvement continued into his senior year, as he averaged 27 points and 11 rebounds a game. Similarly, the basketballer led the Bulldogs to a 24-5 record with his leadership.</p><p>On top of that, he set a school record of 676 points made and 106 steals made. Despite his great potential in basketball, he was only recited by three universities.</p><h3>Collegiate Career</h3><p>Wade committed to Marquette University and&nbsp;played under coach Tom Crean. However, D-Wade was sidelined due to his poor academic result.</p><p>Hence, the athlete began to put effort into and went to tutoring classes. This raised his academic standard, and by the start of his sophomore year, he was eligible to play.</p><p>Instantly, The Flash led the Marquette Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 ppg. Nonetheless, this effort was not enough to win the NCAA tournament.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dwyane-Wade-At-Marquette-University.jpg><p>For the next season, Wade again led the Golden Eagles in scoring with 21.5 points. Thus, the team finished 27-6.</p><p>Moreover, three days later, his mom was released from prison and saw him play for the first time in five years. The NBA player was playing against the Kentucky team.</p><p>Likewise, this game with Kentucky drew national attention as he averaged a triple-double to advance to the Final Four. His triple-double was the fourth ever recorded in NCAA history.</p><p>Therefore, this performance earned him a high NBA draft projection. As a result, the shooting guard skipped his senior year to enter the 2003 NBA Draft.</p><p>You can find the biographical info, latest news, career stats, game logs, awards, and achievements related to Dwyane Wade on the <a href=#>Basketball reference website</a>.</p><h2>Dwyane Wade | NBA Career</h2><h3>Miami Heats, Draft, And First NBA Title</h3><p>Upon the draft, Miami Heat selected D-Wade with the fifth overall pick. As usual, he instantly became the team leader as the heat made the playoffs that season.</p><p>Moreover, Wade performed exceptionally well in the postseason. He became only the fourth rookie in his ear to lead his team in points and assists during the playoffs.</p><p>Furthermore, in the offseason, Heats make a blockbuster trade by acquiring Shaq O’Neal. This trade improved their standing and took them as far as the Eastern Conference Finals.</p><p>However, they lost to the defending champions Detroit Pistons in a seven-game series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dwyane-Wade-With-LeBron-James-scaled.jpg><p>Likewise, in the 2005-06 season, the Heat again qualified for the playoffs. This time they get past the Detroit Pistons to advance into the NBA Finals.</p><p>Eventually, they face the Dallas Mavericks. Alongside Wade’s heroic performance in games 3, 4, and 5, the Heat beat the Mavericks to win the 2006 NBA Championship.</p><p>The heroic performance from the athlete earned him the Finals MVP trophy. As a result, he became the fifth-youngest player in NBA history to capture the Finals MVP award.</p><p>The following season the one-time champion faced a setback with multiple injuries. Nonetheless, he did recover in time for the playoffs but was swept in the first round.</p><p>Learn More About Legendary Coach And Miami Heat President: <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>&lt;&lt;Pat Riley Bio: Wife, Net Worth, Coach, NBA & Heats >></a></strong></p><h3>Consecutive NBA Championship, Return To Miami Heat, And Retirement</h3><p>The following two seasons saw a downfall of the Heat as they didn’t make it past the first round. Alongside that, the basketballer becomes a free agent in the offseason of 2010.</p><p>Nevertheless, he and Chris Bosh decided to sign with the Heat. The following day, <a href=# rel=noopener>LeBron James</a> announced he would join the Heat. Thus, they formed a Big Three for the Heat.</p><p>In the first year, the big three fell to the Dallas Mavericks. Eventually, they prevailed back the next year by winning the NBA Championships.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, they were successfully able to defend the title and be crowned back-to-back champions. Furthermore, they were predicted to win their third back-to-back the next season too.</p><p>However, they lost to the Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals in five games. Consequently, James left to rejoin the Cavs, whereas Wade and Bosh re-signed with the Heats.</p><p>Further, the basketballer would remain with the heats for two seasons after opting out of his contract. Ultimately he left the Heat to play for the Chicago Bulls.</p><p>After two years of a detour, the athlete is traded back to Miami at the trade deadline.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, he announced his intentions to retire after the 2018–19 season in the offseason. As a result, he and Dirk were granted a special roster addition for the 2019 All-Star game.</p><p>Moreover, the Heat retired Wade’s No. 3 jerseys on February 22, 2020. As of now, the shooting guard serves as a host on Turner Sports’ NBA on TNT Tuesday Night.</p><p>He stars alongside former basketballers like <a href=#>Shaquille O’Neal</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Candace Parker</a>, and host Adam Lefkoe. Besides that, he is involved in several TV projects and sponsorship deals.</p><h3>Career With The Chicago Bulls And The Cleveland Cavaliers</h3><p>After not reaching any deals with the Heat, the flash joined the Chicago Bulls. Further, he teamed up with <a href=# rel=noopener>Jimmy Butler</a> and Rajon Rando to form a big three of their own.</p><p>However, the big three failed as they lost to the Celtics in the first round of the playoffs. As a result, the Bulls Traded Butler and waved Rondo.</p><p>Likewise, they negotiated a buyout with Dwyane that allowed him to join the Cavs in 2017. Initially, the Cavs’ coach wanted him to come off the bench, which he denied.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dwyane-Wade-With-Kobe-Bryant.jpg><p>Nevertheless, after a blowout loss from the Magic, he volunteered to come off the bench. Even though the Cavs were still a mess as they couldn’t win with the current roster.</p><p>Hence, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavs traded almost every member except James.

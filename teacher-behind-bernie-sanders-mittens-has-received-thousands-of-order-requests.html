Ellis shared on Twitter. "It truly has been an amazing and historic day! I'm so flattered that Bernie wore them to the inauguration. Sadly, I have no more mittens for sale. There are a lot of great crafters on ETSY who make them."</p><p>While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jewish Insider</a> on Wednesday evening, Ellis -- who made the mittens for Bernie five years ago -- said the response has been "unexpected," revealing that she had received approximately 6,000 emails from people asking about a tweet she had shared nearly a year prior in which she had advertised the homemade mittens.</p><p>Although Ellis is "flattered" that people are interested in buying the knit gloves -- which she calls "swittens" -- she said she doesn't make the mittens very often anymore.</p><p>"Honestly, I don't really do it a lot anymore," she explained. "There are lots of people on Etsy who sell them and hopefully people will get some business from them. But I’m not going to quit my day job. I am a second grade teacher, and I'm a mom, and all that keeps me really busy."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thanks for all the interest in Bernie's mittens! It truly has been an amazing and historic day!

"I hate to disappoint people, but the mittens, they're one-of-a-kind and they're unique and sometimes in this world, you just can't get everything you want."</p><p>Ellis gifted Bernie a pair of her homemade mittens back in 2016 after he had lost the Democratic presidential nomination. Bernie's daughter-in-law, Liza Driscoll, was the director of the preschool Ellis' daughter attended at the time. And Ellis had made the colorful mittens for all the teachers as well as Bernie.</p><p>"I was making mittens for holiday gifts for the preschool teachers," Ellis told Jewish Insider. "And I made an extra pair for Bernie. I gave them to Liza to give to him, just as a thank you."</p><p>Bernie went on to wear the mittens on his 2020 presidential campaign trail in New Hampshire before he wore them again at <a href=#>President Biden's</a> inauguration this week.</p><p>"He must really like them if he chose to wear them," Ellis said of Bernie, who the teacher said she's "always voted for."</p><p>While Ellis has yet to meet Bernie -- who has served as a senator of Vermont since 2007 -- she hopes she will get the chance to meet him in the future.</p><p>"Someday, maybe he'll be walking down Church Street, and maybe I'll just come up and introduce myself and say hi," Ellis said. "I want him to keep doing what he's doing and fighting the good fight."</p><a id=gallery-link-5cef8e29-856b-47e2-be6e-d7da02f558f7 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:5cef8e29-856b-47e2-be6e-d7da02f558f7 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:5d09538a-c947-46f5-8308-2373899f4f04 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/28/4by3/2021/01/20/2841276332494c5e8ab616838bb18d7e_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2pma2pfqbKir8eeqWaalZ22r7CMm5yrppmaerStzZ2cq6tdora1wMSnqmagkah6s7HCnqCvnZRiwam71KyYp5yjYrynec6rm56qXaeyssHErKusZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fteacher-behind-bernie-sanders-mittens-has-received-thousands-of-order-requests.html&text=Bernie%20Sanders%27%20Mitten%20Maker%20Says%20She%27s%20Received%20Thousands%20of%20Orders%20After%20Inauguration&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteacher-behind-bernie-sanders-mittens-has-received-thousands-of-order-requests.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteacher-behind-bernie-sanders-mittens-has-received-thousands-of-order-requests.html&title=Bernie%20Sanders%27%20Mitten%20Maker%20Says%20She%27s%20Received%20Thousands%20of%20Orders%20After%20Inauguration" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fteacher-behind-bernie-sanders-mittens-has-received-thousands-of-order-requests.html&title=Bernie%20Sanders%27%20Mitten%20Maker%20Says%20She%27s%20Received%20Thousands%20of%20Orders%20After%20Inauguration" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fteacher-behind-bernie-sanders-mittens-has-received-thousands-of-order-requests.html&title=Bernie%20Sanders%27%20Mitten%20Maker%20Says%20She%27s%20Received%20Thousands%20of%20Orders%20After%20Inauguration" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteacher-behind-bernie-sanders-mittens-has-received-thousands-of-order-requests.html&description=Bernie%20Sanders%27%20Mitten%20Maker%20Says%20She%27s%20Received%20Thousands%20of%20Orders%20After%20Inauguration" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fbi-cracks-curious-case-tom-bradys-missing-super-bowl-jersey-its.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="FBI cracks the curious case of Tom Bradys missing Super Bowl jersey as its tracked down in Mex">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./police-suspect-in-earlier-meth-investigation-drove-stolen-car.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Police: Suspect in earlier meth investigation drove stolen car">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

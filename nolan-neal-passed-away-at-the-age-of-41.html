The plot is still in the works, and more information will be released shortly. His funeral arrangements are yet unclear.</p><h2>Nolan Neal’s cause of death</h2><p>The official cause of death for Nolan Neal has yet to be disclosed. He was discovered dead at his residence, as previously stated, with some accounts suggesting that his roommate discovered his corpse.&nbsp;Officers discovered a guitar pack on the desk beside Neal’s bed that seemed to be made of powdered residue. However, it is uncertain if the powder was the cause of his death.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nolan-Neal-2.jpg alt="Nolan Neal" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Meanwhile, Seals, his cousin, said that he lived with him before the COVID-19 outbreak and was clean and sober at the time. Having said that, Neal has previously been honest about his fight with drug misuse. In an interview with WBIR in 2020, the singer revealed that he was battling addiction while competing on The Voice.</p><p>He last commented on Facebook three days ago, mentioning his impending concert at Nashville’s Hotel Indigo. The performance was scheduled for July 17 from 6 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. The event was free to attend, but Neal subsequently posted in the comments area that the management canceled the performance for no apparent reason.</p><h2>All about Nolan Neal</h2><p>Nolan Neal competed in the 15th season of America’s Got Talent, reaching the quarterfinals. He also rose to prominence as a participant in Season 10 of The Voice. His songs earned about six million views on YouTube after his performance on America’s Got Talent.

In April 2022, he posted a Facebook tribute to his work on Saliva’s album Love, Lies, and Therapy.&nbsp;Throughout his life, he battled drug addiction. The musician told WIBR that he went to treatment and became clean in 2010. Neal said that he joined the rock band Hinder and was influenced by their extravagant lifestyle. He went on to say that he was attempting to be normal and lying to himself about his ability to handle it.&nbsp;Despite being a well-known figure, he did not have a Wikipedia page, hence his birth date and parents’ names are unclear.</p><h2>Twitter users pay tribute</h2><p>Nolan Neal, a gifted vocalist, has become a household name over the years.

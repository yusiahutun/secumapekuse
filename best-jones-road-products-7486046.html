I tested 11 makeup products from Jones Road over a span of two weeks. I incorporated their TikTok famous foundation, to-die-for lip tint, and other best-sellers into my daily makeup routine, and there were some very clear winners. I also spoke with other editors and beauty experts to learn their favorite products as well. Out of my research and experience testing the products, I created the below list of the very best Jones Road products, tried and true.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-universal-jones-road-beauty-miracle-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Universal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road Beauty Miracle Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road Beauty Miracle Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eO2fTUfxTHInSauEBO_n6bYV5no=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-beauty-miracle-balm-f200e3a92a8a4db9b5a55c3ee2bb9482.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road Beauty</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It adds an all-around natural radiance to the face.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If you have oily skin, it can feel like a little too much moisture on you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps the most beloved and sought-after Jones Road product is their Miracle Balm. It gets its name from the fact that the dewy balm miraculously works as a highlighter, skin tint, moisturizer, and blush — all at once.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a light-reflecting face balm, it adds just enough glow and color to make you look healthy and radiant, which is why it left us raving about the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skin-enhancing properties</a> it offers. Available in nine shades, from rosier hues that give a warm glimmer to bronzier shades for a golden glow, the face balm adds a natural-looking luminosity to the skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But it’s more than just a pop of radiance — the balm also comes with skin-enhancing ingredients, like jojoba seed oil, argan oil, and vitamin E, to keep the skin hydrated and nourished.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, anyone with oil-prone skin might find the buttery texture a little too decadent — but it’s nothing a light dusting of powder can’t fix.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>9 | <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Jojoba seed oil, vitamin E, argan oil | <strong>Size</strong>: 1.76 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-foundation-jones-road-beauty-what-the-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Foundation</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road Beauty What the Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road Beauty What the Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2638WMrlty15BKIqVQfOcYN_Bwc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-what-the-foundation-b27d8a60043342b4a201570b648512bc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road Beauty</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This foundation makes skin look how it should on its best day – glowy, well rested, and hydrated.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s a little sticky, and you’ll need to spend some time blending before applying anything over it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found the product’s name, “What the Foundation,” to be accurate. The formula starts off thick and creamy before disappearing onto the skin’s surface. In fact, I had to reapply a second coat just to make sure I was seeing things correctly! Sure enough, the deceivingly dense formula melted like butter onto my face. It felt extremely hydrating and smooth — almost like second skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The foundation caused a bit of a stir on social media, as Bobbi Brown herself jumped into a conversation among influencers about how to correctly apply this product. TikTok influencer and founder Bobbi Brown herself. According to Brown, you need to understand the foundation’s purpose in order to love it. It’s not intended to be a full-coverage foundation that covers all your blemishes. Instead, it works almost like a moisturizing skin tint to make skin look even toned and healthy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were so curious about this foundation that we even tested it on several InStyle editors and writers, the results of which you can see <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>here</a>. When you’re looking to give your natural glow a little boost, this is the foundation you turn to, although I did notice that the formula felt a little sticky at first and needed a few moments to dry down.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>12 | <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Jojoba seed oil, glycerin | <strong>Size</strong>: 1.14 oz</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mascara-jones-road-the-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mascara</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road The Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road The Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3rgtQI1Wj99_OFq48zSsH9MvM6U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-the-mascara-3e7ce25bc15b4ddaac7383692b55f8d5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It creates a noticeably dramatic look, which makes it great for people with short or thin lashes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>A lot of product comes out at once, creating a bit of a chunky look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While other Jones Road products lean on the minimal, the subtle, and the natural, their mascara is the exception to the rule. I found this product to be fantastic for someone with short and thin lashes (I have the classic short Asian eyelashes), because it creates a really dramatic effect on the eyes that’s hard to miss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When I pulled the wand out of the tube, I noticed a very thick and bushy brush, dosed heavily in formula. At first, I wanted to dab some of the excess product off, but I refrained, and I’m so happy that I did, as one single swipe onto my lashes achieved an instantly volumized look.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Be aware that a lot of product comes out in one stroke, so may want to fan out your lashes to soften any clumps, but once you do, you’ll be met with the longest, luscious, and dramatic lashes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Vitamin E, glycerin | <strong>Size</strong>: 0.3 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-concealer-jones-road-beauty-the-face-pencil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Concealer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road Beauty The Face Pencil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road Beauty The Face Pencil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qe7AE0XPIUe-ChuSNh6LyLmo6WE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-the-face-pencil-2701ba2509dc42318fc1234a325abc60.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road Beauty</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The shade range is inclusive, with more than 25 colors to choose from.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The formula feels a little dry.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jones Road’s Face Pencil acts as a concealer for dark circles, blemishes, and any other discoloration. Rather than a traditional liquid concealer, this one can be drawn on like a crayon.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Both <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jessica Mahgerefteh</a>, InStyle’s commerce director, and I agreed that the formula felt slightly dry when we used it on its own. However, when we applied it over a layer of What the Foundation or their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">eye cream</a>, it went on much smoother.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But the best part is the inclusive shade range. With 25 colors, there’s a face pencil not just for&nbsp; the pale, the tan, and the dark-skinned, but also for those with yellow and reddish undertones, or hints of pink as well. Since it’s so small and lightweight, it’s easy to just keep in your pocket while on the go, to touch up little blemishes while out and about.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>25 | <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Shea butter | <strong>Size</strong>: 0.1 oz</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Biance Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lip-jones-road-the-lip-tint></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road The Lip Tint</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road The Lip Tint" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/h9aPDKmRj3RnqPhrXfkFpvatGGA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-the-lip-tint-978f6093766c48f88f5db8cc1325ebe9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The formula blends in with your lips very naturally.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It requires some frequent reapplication if you’re out and about.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">My oh my, how I’m tempted to go back and get every single shade of this lip tint. Out of all the products I tested from Jones Road, this one stood out to me as the clear winner. To say that I adore this lip tint with its easy application (no lip pencil is required to outline the frame of your lips), flawless blend, and lasting stain, is an understatement.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I tried the nude rose shade, and it’s the perfect, casual color to go for a little coffee in town or to meet some friends on a Saturday afternoon. Because it is a lip tint rather than a lipstick, the formula melts into lips flawlessly, instead of sitting on top like a second layer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like any lip product, if you’re eating and drinking, the color will fade. However, the application is smooth and easy, and can even be done without a mirror. I’ve found a new favorite must-have beauty product in this lip tint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>13 | <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Castor seed oil | <strong>Size</strong>: 0.06 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-blush-jones-road-beauty-lip-and-cheek-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Blush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road Beauty Lip and Cheek Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road Beauty Lip and Cheek Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/p79GryFT3PcUklWd94oHrQN9oBI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-lip-and-cheek-stick-eaba07a1d09f4848897345cc0dfdb1ac.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road Beauty</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It works double duty, staining both your cheeks and your lips.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The applicator wasn’t designed for the lips, so it’s more difficult to apply there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there’s one thing I love to bring with me as I dash out the door, it’s this lip and cheek stick.

On the lips, it looks like a traditional lipstick at first, but then it dries into the skin so naturally, making it appear more like a lip stain. It also stays in place for most of the day, and doesn’t need much touching up (unless you’re eating and drinking a lot).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fact that this product works double duty makes it an essential piece to keep in my purse — I love to accomplish more with less.

The glimmering face oil is available in four shades: Midas, Bronze, Pink Opal, and Cool Rose, all of which add a subtle luminosity to skin and brighten your complexion overall.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This oil does more than simply highlighting your visage. The formula features a trio of hydrating oils — sunflower, coconut, and jojoba — to support the skin barrier, while giving you a natural shine. The oils feel extremely lightweight on skin, so I don’t worry about the oil clogging my pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Much like the foundation, the oil is slightly deceiving. In the bottle and in your hand, the color looks quite rich, but once it glides on, it disperses and almost disappears. You can just barely notice the sparkle at certain angles when catching the sun. Perhaps that’s a good thing, however, as you’re spared from looking like Edward Cullen in the sun.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the summer, when your skin is looking its best, you could easily get away with only applying this face oil and skipping a foundation altogether.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Jojoba seed oil | <strong>Size</strong>: 0.5 oz<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Bianca Kratky</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-skin-care-jones-road-beauty-hippie-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Skin Care</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road Beauty Hippie Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road Beauty Hippie Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bmQWXO80BL9125g6zG1XbdoaVIc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-the-hippie-stick-650c59a03f0d47fd9fb1575285a9d898.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road Beauty</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can be applied to just about anywhere that needs moisturizing, be it your face, hair, or body.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The beeswax scent might take some getting used to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You know those perpetually dry patches of skin that never feel like they’re healing? Well, this Hippie Stick, with its combination of beeswax, sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, and castor oil, helps provide instant relief to such areas. And while I’m not saying other creams can’t provide similar benefits, most don’t come in an extremely handy stick that can quickly be rubbed into dry patches without a mess. I’ve been using this around my ankles, and already my skin feels significantly softer and more supple.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Jones Road calls it an everywhere balm, as it’s quite literally intended to be used on your face, hair, and body — all in the same way. Wherever you’re in need of moisture, this stick can be applied as a salve. It has a subtle beeswax scent, however, which some may or may not like.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Ingredients</strong>: Beeswax, coconut oil, sunflower seed oil, castor oil | <strong>Size</strong>: 2.65 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Every single one of the products mentioned above has been tested and approved by members of the beauty team here at InStyle.

"I kept getting cards that were telling me to appreciate the moment more and acknowledge how far I’ve come," she says. "I feel like I am going through a very transformative time. I’m reaching a new point in my life, I’ve had a big year..."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That "big year" has seen Ortega appear in several high-profile films, including the latest in the Scream franchise, and star in global campaigns for Dior and Adidas. Most notably, she was front and centre of the Addams Family reboot <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/make-up-nails/a42130749/jenna-ortega-wednesday-lipstick-make-up-products/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Wednesday class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Wednesday</a> – a Tim Burton-directed phenomenon that became Netflix’s most popular English-language show of all time. Ortega’s performance was critically acclaimed, earning her nominations for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe. She was propelled to new levels of fame, and thrust into the kind of intense, glaring spotlight that today comes hand in hand with viral memes, vicious trolls and adoring, obsessive fans.</p><img alt="a woman in a black dress" title="Jenna Ortega Women of the year harper's bazaar " width=2000 height=2649 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jenna-1-654223a456179.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Agata Pospieszynska</span><p>Tulle dress, Simone Rocha.

Many of us may hazily recall 21st birthdays spent propping up the bar, but Ortega enjoyed a day on the beach in Normandy, riding for the first time (despite being "terrified of horses"), listening to music, "napping in a field" and writing in her journal, followed by an early night. When we speak the morning after, I suggest that it sounds like a remarkably wholesome way to have marked the milestone. "I felt a lot of pressure," she responds, laughing. "It’s so funny – people had all these different opinions on how I should celebrate. They wanted me to go clubbing, but that’s just really not my speed. I like my peace and quiet." It was, she thinks, the first time she hasn’t had to work on her birthday in 10 years.</p><img alt="a woman in a black dress" title="Jenna Ortega Women of the year harper's bazaar " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jenna-2-654224e0c0b91.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Agata Pospieszynska</span><p>Embroidered jacket; lace corset, both from a selection, Alaïa</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I feel like I am going through a very transformative time"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She is, of course, working today (allowing herself just a little post-birthday lie-in), at the townhouse in the centre of Paris where her Harper’s Bazaar cover shoot is taking place. When we first find a moment to talk, she’s sitting barefoot and cross-legged on a chair, wearing an enormous tulle Dior gown that spills out over her knees and onto the floor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In front of the camera, Ortega is mesmerising to watch and naturally photogenic. Between takes, she is quiet and contemplative (by her own admission, she’s a "massive introvert") and, when asked if she wants to see a preview of the shoot on the monitor, she politely declines. Similarly, she can’t look at herself acting on screen because, she says, she’s her own worst critic and tends to fixate on what she could have done better. "I can’t watch my work, as I know I won’t be able to push forward and continue to grow as an actor if I cling on to certain things," she explains. "A lot of people in my profession can probably relate to this: when you do a take you don’t like, you go to bed kicking yourself. But ultimately, all I can do is be vulnerable and honest when the camera’s on, and then I have to move on and let it go. It’s really hard for me to not feel in control."<br></p><img alt="a woman with brown hair" title="Jenna Ortega Women of the year harper's bazaar " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jenna-3-6542258a41a37.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Agata Pospieszynska</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Control, or the lack thereof, is a recurring theme throughout our conversation, and something that Ortega is actively looking to reclaim. "My career really has been in the hands of so many other people," says the actress, who secured her first job at the age of nine after her mother shared a video of her reciting a monologue on Facebook. "I’ve worked and operated with individuals who maybe didn’t always have my best interests..." She trails off, before correcting herself. "As a kid, I was always being told what I should and shouldn’t do – which way I should go, what would be best for me. But in the end, I’m the only one who’s ever going to know that." From now on, she is determined to have more agency. "I want to be able to really orchestrate my own future and make more specific, precise moves," she continues. "I’ve even begged a little bit to be allowed to make a mistake. Because how can I learn if I don’t do that for myself? I can’t be scared of the fact that I might fall on my face. But it’s hard to do that when so many people are watching."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And there are a lot of people watching. At the time of writing, Wednesday has had more than 250 million views worldwide; Ortega herself now has upwards of 40 million followers on Instagram and another 21 million on TikTok. Dealing with the sheer volume of attention has made her highly attuned to how she may be perceived, and to the risk of her words being taken out of context. "This past year, there have never been more opinions or rumours or thoughts shared about things that I’ve [apparently] said," she tells me, explaining that statements have been attributed to her "that I’ve never said in my entire life, on topics that I have no involvement in. It’s absolutely ridiculous. I don’t want people to take everything that they see at face value and fully believe it’s the truth."</p><img alt="a woman in a dress" title="Jenna Ortega Women of the year harper's bazaar " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jenna-4-654225df856e7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Agata Pospieszynska</span><p>Lace shirt, matching skirt, silk bra, matching knickers, all Dior</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">The second time we chat, away from the distractions of the shoot, is over Zoom a week later. Ortega is fresh-faced, with wet hair, and appears visibly more relaxed, having just spent a weekend socialising. She apologises for the washing machine being on in the background, and seems genuinely delighted to be having such a mundane morning, staying at a friend’s house. "I think I’ve spent less than a week in my apartment in the last two years," she says. "I’m never there. I’m almost more comfortable in hotel rooms, which is really, really strange."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The nomadic existence of an actress is one to which Ortega has long been habituated. She grew up as one of six children in the Coachella Valley, with parents of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, and has wanted to perform for as long as she can remember. Her mother, an ER nurse, used to regularly take time off work to drive her the five-hour round trip to LA for auditions; Ortega, who has a keen sense of responsibility, has worked hard to make sure that her family’s sacrifices were worth it. "I worry about letting people down," she says. "They’ve all invested so much that I wanted them to feel like they put their time and effort in the right place."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I can’t be scared that I might fall on my face. But it’s hard when so many people are watching"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She has always been conscientious, and recalls being "distraught" when, on one occasion during her schooldays, she missed a question on a maths test ("It killed me for weeks and weeks"), although she still managed to achieve the top mark in the class. Deciding to go into showbiz at the same time certainly added to the pressure she was under. "As a child actor, there are two jobs that you can get: you’re either the younger version of someone or you’re playing somebody’s daughter – and there were just not many leading Hispanic actors who I could be that for," she says. "So a lot of the jobs that I was going for growing up would never work out, because I didn’t look [a certain] way. That was really hard, to hear that something you couldn’t change was what was preventing you [from succeeding]."</p><img alt="a woman wearing a dress" title="Jenna Ortega Women of the year harper's bazaar " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jenna-5-6542264a8e1db.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Agata Pospieszynska</span><p>Silk dress, Celine by Hedi Slimane. Leather heels, Jimmy Choo</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Those experiences had a negative impact on her self-esteem ("I wanted to dye my hair blonde so that I would look like Cinderella," she confesses), but she eventually came to realise that by being herself, she would become a far more powerful role model. "I thought, 'I don’t want other young girls to look up at the screen and feel like they have to change their appearance to be deemed beautiful or worthy'," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As part of the diaspora, she is aware that "there’s a lot of debate and discourse about what it means to truly be Latina". She expresses a degree of embarrassment that her Spanish is not perfect. "I wasn’t born in a Spanish-speaking country, I haven’t spent a lot of time in Mexico and I’ve never been to Puerto Rico – so there’s a feeling of not being worthy enough to be a proper representative," she says. However, she hopes her presence helps take things in the right direction. "I want all people of Latin descent to be able to see themselves on screen. I want to feel that I could open doors for other people."</p><img alt="a woman in a dress" title="Jenna Ortega Women of the year harper's bazaar " width=2000 height=2650 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jenna-ortega-6-6542271d9883d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Agata Pospieszynska</span><p>Embellished satin dress, 16Arlington. Leather heels, Jimmy Choo</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ortega is slowly learning to channel her anxiety into positive action. "What helps me sleep at night is knowing that everybody –no matter how successful or hard-working, is flying by the seat of their pants," she says. "Nobody knows what’s going on. Everybody’s doing something for the first time. Somebody does not have one up on you. Nobody is below you. We’re all on a level playing field because we’re all just naturally terrified." She is increasingly exploring opportunities to move behind the camera– an interest that stems from her desire to exercise both her creativity and her voice. For the second series of Wednesday, she will return as a producer as well as the lead. The next step, she says, would be to direct: "The older I get, and the more I work, the more I see myself focusing on that." Beyond this, she says she is interested in composing, because music is her "love language" (she learnt the cello for Wednesday, and has a synthesiser that she plays on "for hours"). "It’s the way I connect with people on set or form bonds, or even make friends, really," she says. "I try to find the music nerds!" She also enjoys writing in her spare time, because "it’s like free therapy".</p><img alt="jenna ortega harper's bazaar december 2023 cover" title="Jenna Ortega Women of the year harper's bazaar " width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jenna-ortega-7-6542278c79f5c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Agata Pospieszynska</span><p>Poplin and silk blouse, Dior</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So what, I wonder, did that birthday tarot reading tell her about her future? "I want to appreciate what I’ve accomplished," she says, after careful thought. "When I really sit back and think about it, it’s truly mind-blowing. But there’s so much more waiting for me on the other side. If I mess up, I mess up, and that’s OK." She pauses and smiles. "I don’t know what’s coming – but I’m excited that I get to figure it out."</p><img alt="a woman on a magazine cover" title="Jenna Ortega" width=2000 height=2799 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cover-jenna-ortega-hr-65410c809eda7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Agata Pospeiszynska</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1sb3FmboRze8CwmKuco2K2tL%2FUnmSjnZ6jrm670a2coJlf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fawards-issue-jenna-ortega.html&text=Women%20of%20the%20Year%20Awards%202023%20Jenna%20Ortega%20cover%20shoot%20and%20interview&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fawards-issue-jenna-ortega.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fawards-issue-jenna-ortega.html&title=Women%20of%20the%20Year%20Awards%202023%20Jenna%20Ortega%20cover%20shoot%20and%20interview" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fawards-issue-jenna-ortega.html&title=Women%20of%20the%20Year%20Awards%202023%20Jenna%20Ortega%20cover%20shoot%20and%20interview" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fawards-issue-jenna-ortega.html&title=Women%20of%20the%20Year%20Awards%202023%20Jenna%20Ortega%20cover%20shoot%20and%20interview" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fawards-issue-jenna-ortega.html&description=Women%20of%20the%20Year%20Awards%202023%20Jenna%20Ortega%20cover%20shoot%20and%20interview" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./naked-models-years-pirelli-calendar-karlie-kloss-adriana-lima.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="You Wont See Any Naked Models In This Years Pirelli Calendar, But You Will See Karlie Kloss, A">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./01-0112-20230420-596-659-directo-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amistosos selecciones: Estados Unidos vs Mxico EN VIVO Online.

While working on the film, Zendaya was 23 while John was 35. But the duo wasn't worried about their 12-year age gap and explained that the difference was probably exacerbated because Zendaya usually plays younger characters.</p><p>"I've played a 16-year-old since I was 16... You have to remember, also, people grew up with me as a child. It's like watching, I guess, your younger sibling now, you know, they're grown... So it's hard for people to wrap around the idea that I am grown in real life. You know, even though I do play a teenager on television still," Zendaya told <a href=#><u>E!'s Daily Pop</u></a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5255c388-91f5-492a-9954-91225b0bec67 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b4aa7b8a-2255-4e67-aab4-8a6c626e1a99 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/03/5by4/2021/01/28/0331bdd4f5984d12a71c2ec46bfabee2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Netflix</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Zendaya Says 'I Am Grown' Amid Criticism Over Age Gap Between Her and John David Washington</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Emma Stone</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Colin Firth</strong></a></p><p>While Emma Stone was filming "Magic In The Moonlight" with Colin Firth, she was just 25 while Colin was 53 -- the same age as her dad. While some viewers expressed concern about the age gap, Emma and Colin said that it didn't bother them.</p><p>"It wasn't written in. I noticed it. I'm not celebrating being on the unflattering end of an age difference. Yes, it didn't concern me... I just allowed it — I hope that would give it a pass, because it wasn't written in. First I didn't know who was playing the other role. It didn't occur to me that it was a younger person... In the end all that seemed apparent to me was that Emma was right for the role. I mean I quickly couldn't imagine anyone else playing it," Colin told <a href=#>Indiewire</a>.</p><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Billy Bob Thornton</strong></a></p><p>Back in 2001, Scarlett Johansson and Billy Bob Thornton starred in crime drama "The Man Who Wasn't There" despite there being a 30-year age gap between them. In the film, Scarlett plays the teenage daughter of one of Billy Bob's friends who tries to seduce him in his car. At the time of filming Scarlett was just 16-years-old while Billy Bob was 46.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:62725293-e7aa-4d12-bd84-a96f78159165 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b4aa7b8a-2255-4e67-aab4-8a6c626e1a99 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9b/5by4/2021/01/11/9ba1d8f7c37a4900b9ae68856088e180_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">15 Famous Couples Who Got Married In Secret</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Drew Seeley</strong></a></p><p>When Selena Gomez and Drew Seely starred in "Another Cinderella Story" she was just 16 while her co-star was 10 years her senior. Although it was a fairly innocent story, many critics said the age difference between the two was blatantly obvious.</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Debbie Reynolds</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Gene Kelly</strong></a></p><p>In 1952, Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly starred in "Singin' in the Rain" while there was an over 20-year age gap between them. While they were working on the film, Debbie was 19 years old and her love interest Gene was 40.</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Clint Eastwood</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Rene Russo</strong></a></p><p>At the time Clint Eastwood's film "In The Line Of Fire" was released in 1993, he was 63-years-old. His love interest was portrayed by Rene Russo, who was 24 years his junior and 39 at the time of the film's debut.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ec6d5893-178f-4f33-a86e-7f750cb1023c data-container-ref=toofab:article:b4aa7b8a-2255-4e67-aab4-8a6c626e1a99 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e0/5by4/2020/08/18/e0e9917296f2462db481d64b75fa05dc_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Celebrities Who've Run For Political Office</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Liam Neeson</strong></a></p><p>When "Third Person" premiered in 2013, co-stars and on screen love interests Olivia Wilde and Liam Neeson had a 32-year age gap between them. When Liam was 62-years-old, Olivia was 30. While not much was said about the age difference, the duo did later become a meme when a photo of Olivia tying Liam's shoes on set was released. Olivia even <a href=#>shared</a> the meme in celebration of Liam's birthday!</p><p><strong>8. </strong><a href=#><strong>Emmy Rossum</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Gerard Butler</strong></a></p><p>Emmy Rossum had just turned 17 when she began filming "The Phantom of the Opera" in 2003. Meanwhile her co-stars Gerard Butler and Patrick Wilson, who she both had romantic scenes with, were 33 and 30, respectively. At the time, Emmy said her co-stars were the reason she took the job.</p><p>"They're both totally gorgeous. I got to kiss both of them! One of the reasons I took the job," Emmy <a href=#>joked</a>, adding, "But they're both total gentlemen and exceedingly talented."</p><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Will Smith</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Margot Robbie</strong></a></p><p>When "Focus" was released, there was a 22-year age gap between Will Smith and Margot Robbie. While Will was 46, Margot was 24. Margot's role was originally set to be played by Kristen Stewart, but she later dropped out of the film <a href=#>reportedly</a> due to the age gap between herself and Will. Coincidentally, she was also 24.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b6223063-aaab-4514-ae0b-250dd33da708 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b4aa7b8a-2255-4e67-aab4-8a6c626e1a99 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/65/5by4/2020/12/21/653c1a0380424f3ca8049997e2d44e97_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook Watch</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Willow Smith Shares Embarrassing First Date Fart Story on Red Table Talk</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>10. </strong><a href=#><strong>Anne Heche</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Harrison Ford</strong></a></p><p>Back in 1998, Anne Heche and Harrison Ford starred in "Six Days, Seven Nights" while there was a 27-year age gap between the duo.

Join us up ahead as we take a look down memory lane—from his days as the charming Prince of Wales up to his eventual ascent to throne.</p><p>King Charles, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was born on November 14, 1948 at Buckingham Palace in London. As the firstborn male child of the reigning monarch, his position as heir apparent was established from birth. He went on to become a big brother to his little sister, Princess Anne, and little <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1752250>brothers Prince Andrew and Prince Edward</a>, with whom he formed a close bond throughout the years.</p><p>Like many royal children, Charles received his early education through private tutors before becoming the first heir apparent to attend school. The young prince enrolled at Hill House School in West London and then Cheam School in Berkshire. In 1956, he started attending Gordonstoun School in Scotland, a boarding school known for its emphasis on outdoor activities and character development. During his time at school, he developed interests in nature and conservation—which has remained a central focus throughout his life—along with an interest in art, literature, and classical music.</p><p>In 1967, Charles broke royal family tradition by going straight to university instead of joining the British Armed Forces. He enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology, archaeology, and history. His time at Cambridge was marked by his interest in environmental issues and his involvement in various student activities, including theater. While still attending university, Prince Charles was formally invested as the Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle in Wales. This traditional ceremony, which took place on July 1, 1969, marked his formal investiture as the heir apparent to the British throne. He gave an address in both Welsh and English during the ceremony, expressing his commitment to Wales and the United Kingdom.</p><p>As the heir apparent, Prince Charles gradually began to take on more public engagements and represent the monarchy at official events. He made speeches, attended ceremonies, and met with dignitaries, both at home and abroad. Eventually, Charles also enrolled at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell to train as a pilot. He would later join the Royal Navy, where he served on various ships and earned his wings as a helicopter pilot.</p><p>During his late teens and early twenties, Prince Charles’s personal life also began attracting more and more interest from the media. He dated a few notable figures, including Davina Sheffield and Camilla Shand (later Parker Bowles), before eventually meeting Lady Diana Spencer, whom he married in 1981. The future king’s <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1340009>relationship with Princess Diana</a> was one of the most closely watched and scrutinized aspects of his personal life. Their marriage captured the world’s attention, heralded as a fairy-tale union between a future king and a beautiful young princess. However, over time, cracks began to emerge in their union.</p><p>Diana’s struggle with the demands of royal life, combined with the Prince of Wales’ rumored attachment to his former flame, Camilla Parker Bowles, created major tensions within their marriage. The couple—who went on to welcome <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1217049>sons Prince William and Prince Harry</a>—eventually faced well-documented reports of infidelity. Their marital difficulties became increasingly apparent to the public, ultimately leading to their separation in 1992 and divorce in 1996. Despite the end of their marriage, however, Charles and Princess Diana remained devoted parents to their children until the Princess of Wales’ untimely death in 1997. In the aftermath of her passing, Charles faced a challenging balance between personal mourning and public duty, often struggling with the immense public outpouring of grief and the intense media attention that followed Diana’s passing. However, the future heir honored her memory publicly, paying tribute to her humanitarian work and the impact she had made on countless lives.</p><p>Following Diana’s death, Charles rekindled his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1329455>relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles</a>. Camilla was previously married to Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973, but also got divorced by 1995. Charles and Camilla’s relationship became more public in the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were often seen attending events together, and their growing closeness sparked speculation about the nature of their relationship. Despite the controversies surrounding their past, including the public perception of Camilla as the “third party” in Charles’ marriage to Diana, the couple eventually decided to openly acknowledge their relationship. In 2005, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles were married in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall, followed by a service of blessing at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Since then, they have continued to support each other in their respective roles within the royal family and have undertaken numerous charitable and public engagements together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=king-charles-young>King Charles young</h2><p>Charles became king at the age of 73, following his mother Queen Elizabeth’s death in 2022. At his coronation, Charles officially became the oldest person to accede to the British throne, after having been the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. It’s clearly been a long journey from his early days as the Prince of Wales to serving on Britain’s highest throne—so let’s take a look at how far he’s come up ahead.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.5><h2>January 1949: King Charles in his baby basket</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/king-charles-young-3.jpeg><p>This official portrait of baby King Charles was taken at Buckingham Palace when he was about two months old.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>August 1951: King Charles with his father and sister</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/king-charles-young-4.jpeg><p>King Charles is pictured here with his father, the late Prince Philip, and his sister, Princess Anne.

That's why home hair coloring has become increasingly popular. The products available to cover your grays are better than ever, but the abundance of options can make finding the right product a bit of a challenge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's why we turned to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Janet Zeitoun</a>, celebrity hairstylist and founder of SOTAH hair care products, to share her favorite color kits for combating grays and some of her best at-home hair dyeing tips. "There are a few things that make a good home hair dye," says Zeitoun. "Firstly, a company that is accessible for any questions or concerns that might arise when using your dye at home. Additionally, a color kit should always come with instructions on how to perform a patch test to avoid an allergic reaction, and have all the essential tools to assist with application, such as gloves, a tint brush, a tint bottle, activators, and a skin barrier cream."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To find the best hair color kits to cover grays at home, look for options that are easy to use and provide long-lasting color. You'll also want to consider the ingredients and whether the color is permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary. In order to find the best products, we consulted haircare expert Janet Zeitoun for their favorite products for covering gray hair. We also considered the ease of use and color performance of each option. One of our favorites is Christophe Robin's Temporary Color Gel. This naturally formulated gel is free of oxidants and ammonia, easy to use, and safe for all hair types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the best tips and hair dyes for gray hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-step-1-protect-protect-protect></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Step 1: Protect, Protect, Protect</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, remember to protect your workspace, your hairline, your scalp, and your clothing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Protecting the space where you will be dyeing your hair is essential, cover all areas that dye could possibly get to, accidents happen," says Zeitoun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A popular home coloring faux pas is a dyed hairline. If you haven't experienced it, you've probably seen someone with it. To avoid this embarrassing outcome, Zeitoun says it's important to apply a barrier cream before you color your hair. "If your box color doesn't supply you with a skin barrier cream, use something as simple as Vaseline or coconut oil."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-step-2-part-and-apply></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Step 2: Part and Apply</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The key to successfully dyeing gray hair is making sure the hair is fully saturated in dye. To help this process, Zeitoun recommends dividing the hair into four sections. "Within your four sections, use quarter-inch partings when applying your color, this will allow every strand to receive complete saturation of the color," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Start applying your color where you have the most resistant gray hair first. "Resistant gray hair needs the full processing time required to take the color well," says Zeitoun. Once you have finished applying the dye, cross-check to see that you have covered all the gray strands but do not reapply the color. "If you keep overlapping the color, it will make your hair darker and can cause a dark ring around your hair that a professional will need to correct. Color correction can be expensive, so try and avoid this."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-step-3-wait-on-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Step 3: Wait on It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On some occasions you might find that your gray hairs aren't dyeing, this is because gray hair produces little oil and tends to have a rougher surface that sometimes rejects dye, especially around the roots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Coloring your hair will take the necessary time suggested. Have a timer on hand to monitor the time, no cutting corners. Rinsing off your color too early can result in a translucent hue on your roots, uneven coverage, or no coverage at all," says Zeitoun. "Another way to tackle resistant hair is by applying the color developer to the gray areas and allowing it to set for five to eight mins before applying the color. Doing this step will help to swell and lift up the hair cuticle so that it can easily absorb the pigment when you start the color process."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-know-about-after-care></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Know About After Care</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After dyeing your hair, Zeitoun recommends not washing it for three days to add longevity to the color. "After three days, use a non-sulfate shampoo to seal the color into the strands and keep it vibrant," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To maintain a healthy scalp and hair, gray hair should not be colored more than every four weeks. Dyeing too often can cause your hair to become brittle, dull, and damage your hairline.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-maintain-your-color></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Maintain Your Color</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you have dyed your hair, it's important to maintain your color. Gray hair often fades from the midsection of the hair to the ends, giving a dry, dull appearance. "Many home coloring companies offer color glosses. These pigment enhancers bring your color alive and help maintain an even tone."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Black Women's Relationship with Wigs</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-christophe-robin-temporary-color-gel></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Christophe Robin Temporary Color Gel</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a gentle, temporary hair gel that immediately covers grays, and blends with your natural hair color, Christophe Robin's Temporary Hair Gel is one of our favorites. Made with 92% natural ingredients and pure pigments, this formula is recommended for all hair types.

Available in golden blonde, dark blonde, light chestnut, and dark chestnut, "the shades lean more to the darker tones," according to Zeitoun. " If you fancy dark rich shades, this brand is perfect."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The gel is easy to use, and the package includes an applicator brush, gloves, and detailed instructions.

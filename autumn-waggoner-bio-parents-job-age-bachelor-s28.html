Joey Graziadei was announced as the lead for the season in August 2023, and just lately Reality Steve, revealed that its filming officially began on 19 September 2023. Like old times, Joey meets 32 women in the show, and by the end of the night, he sends 10 of them out the door.

The remaining 10</span><span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em> women, Reality Steve says, head to Canada for more dates.

Reality Steve also exposed during an episode of his podcast, that the villain of Joey’s season is Maria Georgas, the one who makes it to the final four before finally getting the boot.

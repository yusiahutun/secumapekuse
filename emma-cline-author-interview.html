The novel was a New York Times bestseller and one of the most talked-about books of the year: an eerie depiction of one lost girl’s Californian summer in 1969 as she finds herself embroiled with a group that may or may not be inspired by the infamous Manson Family. She was in many ways an inheritor of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a38603782/joan-didion-dies-aged-87/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joan Didion" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Joan Didion</a>’s style and subject matter; a writer who herself covered the Manson murders in 1969 and who was also drawn to ‘extremes’.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cline’s long-awaited second novel, The Guest, is no different. Swapping California for The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/travel/a27581916/bazaars-guide-to-the-hamptons/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Hamptons class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Hamptons</a>, it follows Alex, a mysterious sex worker who is, in Cline’s own words ‘Mr Ripley-ing’ her way through East Coast fine society. Set over one claustrophobic summer week, the narrative follows a woman on a survival mission, as Cline draws the reader into Alex’s increasing desperation, like an agile – often amoral – rat stuck in a maze.</p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£19 at Waterstones for " data-href=https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-guest/emma-cline/9781784743734 data-product-url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-guest/emma-cline/9781784743734 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fthe-guest%2Femma-cline%2F9781784743734" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="£19 at Waterstones" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-guest/emma-cline/9781784743734 data-vars-ga-product-id=4ec25a83-8c0f-4b26-9201-2295e21a3eb5 data-vars-ga-product-price=£18.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1c0a963b-f189-4f63-a93a-690322baadd9 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=9781784743734 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1685091426-9781784743734.jpg width=327 height=500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Alex was the starting point for the novel, which I then built around her,” Cline explains. “I knew I wanted her to be different to Evie (The Girls’s protagonist) who was only fourteen and still very much at the mercy of outside forces. I wanted to write a character who at least presented herself as somebody who was in control of every room she walked into.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The tragedy of Alex is, of course, that she is no less at the mercy of outside forces than Evie. In this way, Cline calls both novels explorations of the limitations of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a43788395/golda-rosheuvel-india-amarteifo-queen-charlotte-bridgerton/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="female power " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">female power </a>in a patriarchal world. Forced to hustle her way through a relentlessly cruel coterie of characters and situations, as an outsider gaining an aerial view of the Hamptons set, Alex is both imbued with the power and powerlessness that situation affords. “This is a beautiful place that's still so controlled by certain power dynamics and old ideas,” says Cline. “I was really curious about what would happen to a character in that community who really didn't belong? How would they move through that world? I realised that there is a weird power that you get when people don't really see you, either – they kind of fill in the blanks about who you are. You could be anyone.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"There is a weird power that you get, when people don't really see you... You could be anyone"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Alex, as is expertly illustrated by the nature of her career, is an adept shape-shifter. She becomes whoever she is needed to be by the person she is with. Cline’s mastery of this narrative is how much she sits back and allows us to experience Alex in this way – never quite one thing or another, a woman so up to her neck in her own self-delusions and finely crafted personas that she might, in the end, have no idea who she really is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We return again to Cline’s self-confessed darkness. She is, contrary to her own personality, which is warm, humble and sweetly-funny, not a happy writer. “Oh, for sure,” she laughs again. “The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a43291850/debut-new-authors-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=fiction class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">fiction</a> I like is when our darkest impulses, the things we try to keep other people from knowing about us, are explored. I think that’s the most interesting place to drop into someone's mind.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She is after all, the writer who got into the mind of Harvey Weinstein for her acclaimed New Yorker short story ‘White Noise.’ Set over one sleepless night before the final day of his trial, she afforded him snapshots of both empathetic humanity and grotesque barbarism. Overall, it was another masterful example of Cline’s ability to sit back and present her literary monsters to us without judgement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are myriad more characters like this in Daddy, many of them specifically navigating a post #MeToo landscape: disgraced magazine editors, Hollywood bosses having affairs with their nannies, privileged men abusing their privileges and, frequently the women they are involved with. In what feels like a redundant question to ask the woman who set her first novel within the cult of Charles Manson, I ask her if she is drawn to anti-heroes.</p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£10 at Waterstones for " data-href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-girls/emma-cline//9781784701741?awc=3787_1683724228_5b8d6a7462b8d206b3da7d6d0076c8ae&utm_source=259955&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Genie+Shopping+CSS" data-product-url="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-girls/emma-cline//9781784701741?awc=3787_1683724228_5b8d6a7462b8d206b3da7d6d0076c8ae&utm_source=259955&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Genie+Shopping+CSS" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fthe-girls%2Femma-cline%2F%2F9781784701741%3Fawc%3D3787_1683724228_5b8d6a7462b8d206b3da7d6d0076c8ae%26utm_source%3D259955%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_campaign%3DGenie%2BShopping%2BCSS" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="£10 at Waterstones" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-girls/emma-cline//9781784701741?awc=3787_1683724228_5b8d6a7462b8d206b3da7d6d0076c8ae&utm_source=259955&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=Genie+Shopping+CSS" data-vars-ga-product-id=fa840163-6371-4746-bb67-7f4554b500e4 data-vars-ga-product-price=£9.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=64f31174-6423-48e8-804a-1a19ff7d8bb8 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=9781784701741 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1685091318-9781784701741.jpg width=327 height=500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Yes, I've grown to distrust tidy narratives or endings or any kind of character arcs,” Cline laughs. “I don't want to kind of write a thesis about power and you know, have it all very clear who's good, who's bad, like, this is the moral takeaway. I’m grateful that fiction is free from that. It is an almost amoral space where you can work things out – even dark things – safely and creatively and trust your readers to experience it and come to their own conclusions.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What remains consistent between Cline’s three main literary outputs thus far is her indefatigable sense of style. She is that curious thing – a writer who manages to write novels as though they are <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a40731433/short-story-competition-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="short stories" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">short stories</a>, infusing a near 400-page book with the heady atmosphere of a four-page yarn. “I’m glad you said that,” she smiles. “I’m always trying to see how I can maintain that kind of emotional tone, that 'vibe', over longer prose, because often a novel can feel much more surgical than a short story – there are so many parts you have to be in control of!”<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I’m grateful that fiction is free. It is an almost amoral space"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cline pulls this off perhaps because she is so led by imagery. What began The Guest, Cline tells me, was: “This image I had of a woman being out in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a39955003/minnie-driver-why-i-need-the-sea/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ocean class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">ocean</a>. There are people waiting for her onshore and she has this feeling that as soon as she goes back to land, she is going to be in some horrible trouble. So, she is wishing she could kind of stay out in the ocean forever.” Indeed, what that single snapshot became, was an entire novel about a woman treading water, trying frantically not to drown.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whatever Cline does next, and she is currently writing what she enigmatically calls “something,” there is no doubt it will be as eerie and compelling as what she has penned thus far.

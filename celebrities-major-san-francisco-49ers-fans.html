And while the Niners are based out of the Bay Area, they actually have quite a few fans that hail from Hollywood. Many of these famous faithful fans have stuck by the team through the highs and lows -- and are more than thrilled to witness the team take on its eighth Super Bowl championship. Whether they're watching from home or Allegiant Stadium, these celebs will be showing their Niners pride this weekend.</p><p>Find out which celebs are the biggest 49ers fans…</p><p><strong>1. Jeremy Renner</strong></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>As a California native, <a href=#><strong>Jeremy Renner</strong></a> is a massive fan of the 49ers and has been spotted attending numerous games. In 2017, he narrated the Niners story for NFL Films' <a href=#><strong>A Tale of Two Cities</strong></a>, and he admits that he even once brought an iPad to a red carpet event so he could watch a game in real time. Now that the team is headed to the Super Bowl this year, Jeremy <a href=#><strong>says</strong></a> he is "over the moon."</p><p>"The Niners, I've been watching since 1979," Jeremy shared during an appearance on <a href=#><strong>The Rich Eisen Show</strong></a>, adding that he went to games as a kid. "That was, you know, the era when Walsh and Montana and Rice and all that all that started happening."</p><p><strong>2. Katharine McPhee</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Katharine McPhee</strong></a> has been rooting for the 49s for quite some time! Back in 2013, she stood on the sidelines right before the team was set to take the field at the Super Bowl and she's since been spotted at other games. As a big fan, she's even gotten the opportunity to perform in front of the team, <a href=#><strong>singing the national anthem</strong></a> at a game against the Ravens in 2015.</p><p><strong>3. Andy Samberg</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Andy Samberg</strong></a> was born and raised in Northern California so it only makes sense that he's a big fan of the 49ers. And when the competition gets tough, he doesn't mind talking a little smack. Chiefs fan, Jason Sudeikis, says that he was once in a group chat with Andy and the other members of The Lonely Island -- and things got intense.</p><p>"The [group chat] that was the most fun was when we were… playing San Francisco two years ago and I'd be texting all my buddies from The Lonely Island -- Andy, Jorma and Akiva. They were San Francisco fans, and so we were talking trash back and forth. That was a good one that [the Chiefs] ended up coming out on top of, so that text chain seized pretty quickly afterwards," Jason told <a href=#><strong>USA Today</strong></a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:01f3e5a9-51f5-49f9-ac63-6c21d27361f0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:98f488fd-9569-4e01-b1a9-46197f49e09f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cc/5by4/2024/02/06/cc08f1776d434e82ad35006f5af1b6da_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Every Must-See Commercial for Super Bowl LVIII</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>4. Harry Shum Jr.</strong></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Harry Shum Jr.</strong></a> is a lifelong fan of the 49ers. His family had just moved from Costa Rica to the Bay area when the team made it to the Super Bowl in 1989. Harry says he remembers his family gathered around the television and while they didn't fully understand the sport, the team's win was a moment of victory for the family.</p><p>"It was this uproar in our family even though we didn’t understand the sport, we knew we were in the Bay, rooting for the team that we had just moved to," Harry shared in an episode of <a href=#><strong>Verified Faithful</strong></a>. "It was this victorious feeling that was almost the same thing of how my parents came to this country and how that was already a huge victory. It kind of paralleled that."</p><p><strong>5. Olivia Culpo</strong></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Olivia Culpo</strong></a> has a special connection to the 49ers considering her fiancé, Christian McCaffrey, is a member of the team. She's often spotted wearing team merchandise and showing her support from the sidelines. While she's mastered her WAG status, Christian admits that it comes with a lot of sacrifice for his bride-to-be.</p><p>"She's sacrificed so much and I think all the wives do, but it's tough especially in season, a lot of late nights, a lot of time at the facilities," he <a href=#><strong>told reporters</strong></a> ahead of the big game. "She obviously is so successful in the world right now in her career, and to see her support me the way she does, it means the world to me… and hopefully I can return the favor."</p><p><strong>6. Dana Carvey</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Dana Carvey</strong></a> was raised in Northern California and has been a 49ers fan all of his life. In one of his stand up comedy routines, he even created <a href=#><strong>a song dedicated to the team</strong></a> -- and the chorus was entirely comprised of the celebratory phrase "f---in' 49ers!" Since then, Dana has proudly shared his love for the Niners, including lots of posts on social media.</p><p>"You know your team is really good when you feel sorry for whoever they are playing. Go Niners!" Dana <a href=#><strong>wrote</strong></a> just a few months before the Super Bowl.</p><p><strong>7. Miranda Cosgrove</strong></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Miranda Cosgrove</strong></a> has been known to show her support for the Niners by wearing team apparel and was once even a brand ambassador for the NFL. She says her love for the 49ers comes from her dad, so she's been watching their games for her whole life.</p><p>"I'm personally a fan of Colin Kaepernick," Miranda told <a href=#><strong>ABC</strong></a>. "Football also kind of brings everyone together and my dad loves football and loves sports. For as long as I can remember, I've watched football games with my family."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:167f610f-4d1d-4cc4-8d64-949e190bacc0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:98f488fd-9569-4e01-b1a9-46197f49e09f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f0/5by4/2024/02/07/f09f8e48a50d4098963426de27597a17_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Taylor Swift Shares Album Reveal 'Backup Plan,' Responds to Critics Asking Why So Many Albums</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>8. Bella Thorne</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Bella Thorne</strong></a> has been a fan of the 49ers for quite some time and has been <a href=#><strong>spotted wearing team merch</strong></a> on Super Bowl Sunday. In 2013, she said she'd stick with the team through the high and lows -- and even when they’re losing.</p><p>"i know 49ers are losing...but i stick with a team through good and bad. don't change an opinion based on popularity or pressure!!" Bella <a href=#><strong>wrote on X</strong></a> (formerly Twitter).</p><p><strong>9. Matt Bomer</strong></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Matt Bomer</strong></a> grew up playing football, and when he moved to California, he became a 49ers fan. When his son, Kit, was just a kid, Matt gave him a few options for teams to root for, and he ended up choosing the Niners. Since then, the family have been dedicated fans.</p><p>"We're faithful to the Bay in our home," Matt shared on <a href=#><strong>Live With Kelly and Mark</strong></a>. "When our oldest was about four or five I gave him a choice of California teams to choose from, and I think it was only three teams at the time and none of them were in LA. I may have tipped his hat a little bit towards the Niners by telling him about Jerry Rice and Joe Montana and the catch, but that's who he chose. We've been going to a game almost every season since."</p><p><strong>10. Rob Schneider</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Rob Schneider</strong></a> was born and raised in San Francisco, making him a lifelong fan of the Niners. He's long supported the team but in the past few years, had some issues with the team's CEO Jed York. In fact, in 2017, Rob tried to buy the entire team to change things.</p><p>"Dear Jed York, There is a chance for change at the top! I will put together a consortium of buyers. Please sell me the 49ers," Rob wrote in <a href=#><strong>now-deleted posts on X</strong></a>, later adding, "We will make a formal proposal to Yorks to buy @49ers. We need the faithful San Francisco 49er fans support our plan. Tell Yorks to sell!!"</p><p>In the end, Rob didn't end up buying the team.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dc9565dc-4c68-49c8-998d-5b1ac4b5d12a data-container-ref=toofab:article:98f488fd-9569-4e01-b1a9-46197f49e09f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9d/5by4/2024/01/24/9d36ef6d68f248d18fe267bc055544c8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Travis Kelce Reveals Taylor Swift's Reaction to Jason Kelce's Shirtless Stunt at Chiefs Game</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>11. Dave Coulier</strong></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Dave Coulier</strong></a> may not have grown up in the Bay area but it's been an important place when it comes to his career. Both Full House and its sequel were set in San Francisco, making Dave a big fan of the Niners.</p><p>"#fullhouse and #fullerhouse were both set in San Francisco. And the @49ershave always supported us as much as we do them," Dave <a href=#><strong>wrote on Instagram</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>12. Saweetie</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Saweetie</strong></a> is such a big fan of the Niners that she and rapper P-Lo partnered with the team to drop a song called "Do It For The Bay." The track pays tribute to the 49ers and features lyrics like, "Okay, you ain't gotta ask who I do it for / Whole team iced up, dipped in that red and gold."</p><p>"I'm excited to share our new 49ers single designed to hype up the team and The Faithful for this playoffs run!" Saweetie <a href=#><strong>said</strong></a> in a press release. "I want to thank the 49ers organization for this opportunity. Shout out to P-Lo for doing what he does. I love that we were able to collaborate and make something that's so Bay-triotic, as P-Lo would say."</p><a id=gallery-link-5cee2fe2-5615-4754-b86f-f296321d708d class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:5cee2fe2-5615-4754-b86f-f296321d708d data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:98f488fd-9569-4e01-b1a9-46197f49e09f data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/56/4by3/2024/02/11/564c0b0f5534442db595285e636b2401_md.png width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmamhfmLKtscGroK2hlah6rq3JqKlmq5Gjeqe%2BwKeaoquTpHp1hcSrqmaekaPAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcelebrities-major-san-francisco-49ers-fans.html&text=12%20Celebrities%20Who%20Are%20Major%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20Fans&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebrities-major-san-francisco-49ers-fans.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebrities-major-san-francisco-49ers-fans.html&title=12%20Celebrities%20Who%20Are%20Major%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcelebrities-major-san-francisco-49ers-fans.html&title=12%20Celebrities%20Who%20Are%20Major%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcelebrities-major-san-francisco-49ers-fans.html&title=12%20Celebrities%20Who%20Are%20Major%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebrities-major-san-francisco-49ers-fans.html&description=12%20Celebrities%20Who%20Are%20Major%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./danis-europop-trio-aqua-announce-its-barbie-world-tour-for-todays-barbie-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danish Europop Trio AQUA Announce Its Barbie World Tour For Todays Barbie World">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kim-novak-and-tony-curtis.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Novak and Tony Curtis">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

The octuplets were a surprise result of her last set of six embryos, she said, explaining she had expected twins at most. Two of the embryos evidently divided in the womb.</p><p>Medical ethicists have criticised the implanting of so many embryos. National guidelines put the norm at two to three embryos for a woman of Suleman's age, except in extraordinary circumstances.</p><p>Kamrava's clinic performed 20 IVF procedures on women under 35 in 2006, according to the most recent national report compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br></p><p>Of those 20 procedures, four resulted in pregnancies and two in births.

Transcriptions from the earliest Indian Vedic texts and Chinese medical books mention crystals and gemstones.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Ayurveda, the Vedic tradition of naturopathic medicine, describes in great detail how to prepare elixirs, pastes and powders made from gems to balance out the body’s energies, or doshas, while the Chinese used crystals and gemstones in various types of pastes, powders and solutions for topical application.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Above all other stones, they attributed curative powers to jade, which they used to treat asthma and illnesses related to blood.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the backlash endured by crystals down the centuries, there has been a resurgence of interest in these stones for health and beauty purposes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Business-focused news organisation Quartz wrote recently in one of its Obsession newsletters, “Despite damning coverage of the brutal industry and the lack of evidence that they have any effect on human health, enthusiasm for crystals has only grown. In fact, they’ve become a touchstone of the US$4.2 trillion wellness industry, promising an improbable number of benefits.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/d2344a36-1a2c-11ea-8971-922fdc94075f_972x_105614.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am a logical person, almost sceptical by nature,” says Phoebe Song, founder of Snow Fox Skincare, a vegan skincare brand that caters to sensitive skin types, including those prone to psoriasis and eczema. “It was the results that have made me an enthusiastic holistic health and skincare fan. Having a chronic skin condition forced me to look beyond conventional health treatments.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My old lifestyle was a major cause of my health and skincare issues, so learning how to take self-care seriously was a turning point – physically and mentally. Anything that can reduce stress and increase comfort in your life without a down side, is incredibly valuable. It’s the little enjoyments in life that make it meaningful.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We can all benefit from it, whether it's a beautifully decorated home, scented candles or a face mask in the bath with a fizzy bath bomb and your favourite music.

The duo, who have backgrounds in banking and PR respectively, have launched a portal they describe as “dedicated to nurturing the relationship to self through self love and spiritual well-being”, where there will be a blog exploring “a deeper relationship with themselves”, and a “healer’s directory platform” that will “curate events and workshops so that we can guide them further onto their self-discovery journey.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/04ce89c6-17fc-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_972x_105614.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan says: “When you have a healthy relationship to self, you are full. When you are full, you are able to genuinely share your love and time with those you care for most. Imagine a world where everyone is giving from a full cup. OMSA hopes to be that safe space for everyone to seek deeper meaning of their lives through the items we offer from crystals, aromatherapy to sound healing.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The duo say they have experienced how different healing therapies, such as reiki (they are both certified reiki practitioners), have improved their lives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Thus, my spiritual well-being journey started,” says Chan. “I tried many different modalities such as reiki, shamanic healing, craniosacral therapy, spiritual response therapy and breath work, but a few resonated more than the others which led me to more education, practice and then becoming a healer myself. I love being of service to others and guiding them to unlock the next stage of their journey.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">4 tips on how crystals can help busy Hongkongers to ‘chill out’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho says: “I loved to exercise or participate in activities that brought out the competitive side in me. Naturally, after a decade of this routine, I started to feel burned out – mentally and physically. Over time, I started seeking out more Zen activities – Pilates, barre, yin yoga.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This taught me to tune in and listen to what my body wanted and grow my intuition rather than forcing the latest gym trend on myself. This naturally led me to seek more alternative therapies – firstly through a reiki healing trial class (where Chan and Ho met). A whole new world of ‘woo’ became open to me and I never looked back.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Crystals as a tool</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Crystals are a powerful tool from Mother Earth to help us clear, balance and heal our energies. As a spiritual practitioner, I use crystals every day. As an entrepreneur and new mum, I balance quite a lot so I always keep an amethyst with me near my bedside, on the go and meditate with it. Amethysts are great for easing feelings or anxiety and promoting a good night’s sleep while enhancing your intuition.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/df657cf8-17fb-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_972x_105614.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How are crystals used to enhance meditation?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“During meditation I like using black jasper in one hand, rose quartz and labradorite in the other. Black jasper is a grounding stone and aids in balancing energies while healing. Labradorite is often known as the magician’s stone and amplifies your intuition and further catapults your manifestation work. I love using rose quartz because of its unconditional love frequencies and is a top choice for healing matters of the heart.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rose quartz has become a hot ticket for beauty products. Angela Caglia, who is dubbed the “queen of rose quartz” because of how she has championed this crystal as a healing alternative, discussed her sustainably sourced crystals.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Phoebe Song: beauty brands can no longer justify failure to adopt cruelty-free, vegan practices</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She has been working as a facialist and her story before the brand is like a fairy tale – while she was divorced and working for a bad boss, a chance facial with Barbara Streisand led to her pursuing her dream. “She [Streisand] looked up and asked, ‘What’s your dream?’ And I told her, to run my own skincare brand. And she said, go for it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today it is a self-funded brand, with her business partner and husband.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The mask is not a sleeping mask, but a mask to apply to allow you to de-puff dark circles. I like to keep mine in the refrigerator. It’s like a big [mask] of love and rose quartz,” is Caglia’s response to sceptics; she attributes her success – and that of Courteney Cox and other stars – to the technology she uses with the crystals in her facials. “I combine them,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For example, this [vibrating rose quartz sculpting roller] has 6,000 sonic vibrations, combined with rose crystal. And the crystal has love energy and is a self-esteem booster. Giving the facial with my hands is a way to give them self-confidence, and because I can’t do a facial for everyone in the world, I hope the crystal can do what I cannot do physically.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can move lymphatic drainage with the roller, so it is functional, too,” Caglia describes the rose crystal as a stand-alone ingredient in the roller. Because it stays so cold, you can give yourself a detox, and it stimulates all the blood flow, and helps disperse the dark circles. I am a facialist and I am paid to get results. I have been a facialist for 25 years, and I used to use a lot of machines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Later I used jade rollers because they were popular back then. Six years ago, I found out the [coldness of the stone helps and] that’s when my clients relax the most.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Hair and nails tips and tricks for the holiday season – and 2020</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Song believes there are beauty benefits in jade – white jade, in particular, for gua sha, a traditional Chinese medicine method that helps to detox.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Quartz is a harder stone than white jade, which can make the gua sha too intense for certain people. If your skin is reacting with bumps or discomfort during a gua sha “scraping” session, the tool may be too hard for you. Normally in traditional Chinese treatments, they don’t use quartz gua shas as it’s meant to be a ‘warm’ tool (quartz is a cold stone) and the harder materials are usually reserved for men as it is believed they have thicker skin and body hair to scrape through.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/7de1bd7c-1808-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_972x_105614.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I use my white jade gua sha for scraping sessions with a gua sha therapist and we both love the results. Traditional gua sha is meant to “scrape” the pores open and promote blood circulation in skin, so for people with very sensitive skin (like myself), this can cause discomfort or rashes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A good gua sha should feel very relaxing, a warming, slightly itchy sensation (the blood circulation increasing towards the top layer of skin) and a slight, temporary redness on the “scrape” queues. If it hurts, breaks out in bumps or dark blood spots – it is most likely too harsh. Remember that gua sha is a centuries-old Asian practice that is meant to boost immunity and wellness; it's a lot more than a massage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“White jade gua sha is not common because it is expensive, but any good traditional gua sha therapist will tell you that it’s fantastic for sensitive skin clients who want the same benefits but don’t want to risk bad reactions.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/915af166-1808-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_972x_105614.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Snow Fox has released a kit that includes the gua sha tool as well as a white jade facial roller.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We call our white jade ‘snowy jade’, because we hand-pick the highest quality part of the stone to carve from. There are several types of ‘white’ jade on the market that are really ‘mutton’ jade because they resemble the colour of lard and are completely solid, while the other one is slightly translucent with natural variations in form. The latter is most used in Chinese artistry for its quality – which is why we prefer it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Song warns: “I’m not going to lie about having crystals in your actual skincare products – they’re minerals that do not have any skincare benefits. If they’re being used as massage tools, such as a roller or gua sha, then yes they’re helpful, but don’t listen to any gimmick about having the actual crystal ‘extract’ in your creams.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Combining theories</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aside from beauty uses, crystals can be a grounding and nurturing item to have.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Valerie Ho says, “A crowded bustling place like Hong Kong is enough to raise anxiety levels even during peaceful times. I stay grounded by setting firm mental and physical boundaries. This is a mindset that I adopt with silent affirmations to myself first thing in the morning. This small ritual helps me go about my day with intent, so that others’ negative energy/comments or attitude don’t affect me. If I am in extra need of courage, I will take a crystal with me and rub it in my hand to feel its effect or simply distract me from my angst.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/1dd3b5c2-17fc-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_972x_105614.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How do celebrities Kate Moss and Sienna Miller get their red-carpet glow?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Song says crystals have a value beyond beauty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even the most sceptical of people can still enjoy art history, so I find that this appreciation goes beyond wellness.

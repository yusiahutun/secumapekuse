Kanye West has now compared himself to the King of Rock ‘n’ R</strong>oll,<strong> Elvis Presley.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star, who has just dropped a single with his eldest daughter, North West, took to his Instagram in a now-deleted post, comparing the situation to that of the late Elvis Presley. It comes more than a year after <a href=#>Kanye West</a> made several anti-Semitic rants online. At the end of last year, he <a href=# rel=nofollow>apologized</a> to the Jewish community for his comments. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> said he “deeply regret[s] any pain” he caused and is ‘committed to making amends’.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1956025496-744x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kanye-west-compares-himself-to-elvis-presley-as-he-struggles-to-book-gigs>Kanye West compares himself to Elvis Presley as he struggles to book gigs</h2><p>Taking to his 18.9 million <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers, in a now-deleted post, the Touch the Sky rapper wrote: “I HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO PERFORM IN A YEAR. FEELS LIKE THE ELVIS PRESELY MOVIE.”</p><p>In another deleted post, the rapper revealed the only one he’s been able to book is the United Centre, which is in his hometown, Chicago.</p><p>“We just sold out the United Center in seven minutes, and I just want to express to everybody out there to see if there’s anyone that can help with this. It’s the only arena that I had access to in the past year,” he said.</p><p>“And when I call, people say there are no avails for me and you know why that is,” the star continued, seemingly referring to his anti-sematic comments.</p><p>The desperate star then asked his millions of followers if anyone knew anyone who could help. “So if there’s anybody out there that can help with this, please do.”</p><p>It is unclear in what sense Kanye was comparing himself to the Rock ‘n’ Roll legend, although it’s thought he’s referring to the Jailhouse Rock star being censored and banned from shows due to his ‘provocative’ performances.</p><p>However, Ye’s latest screenshots (which have also been deleted) allude his videos may have helped. Sharing a screenshot of messages with his manager, (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">captured</a> by Page Six) the father of four wrote: “How many offers and avails have we received since I posted that video?”</p><p>The response read: “Crazy amount of nonstop calls from all over the world. Will send new offers and avails tomorrow.” The text then alluded West was planning an Australian Tour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kanye-teases-new-music-with-daughter-north>Kanye teases new music – with daughter North</h2><p>The Runaway star has been delaying the release of his album Vultures, with Ty Dolla $ign for as long as we can remember, but now he’s given us a sneak peek, and it involves daughter North West.</p><p>Taking to Instagram, the 46-year-old dropped a trailer for one of his forthcoming singles Talking/Once Again, and it was his 10-year-old daughter who stole the show.</p><p>“I love it here we gonna take over the year for nothing, yeah. It’s your bestie, miss Miss Westie. Don’t tryna test me,” she could be heard singing as she appeared in the video with her dad.</p><p>Fans were loving the snippet of the collab, as one commented: “It’s crazy how good her first song is.”</p><p>“Something about Kanye doing a collab with his own child that gets me… it’s wholesome,” wrote a second.</p><p>A third penned: “She’s our bestie.”</p><p>The album is set to drop this month, but considering all the other delays, we’re not holding our breath.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WEcLfAp7CeZaeawLV5wqikqZmimsButMimqp6klmLBsHnEpa2iq12lv6a%2Fy56wZpmWqbKzecKlmKKlmaO0brTErGSbmZ6jsqV5xaumpmWTmr%2B1rcinZJqqlaOutHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkanye-west-compares-himself-to-elvis-presley-after-claiming-hes-banned-from-certain-arenas.html&text=Kanye%20West%20compares%20himself%20to%20Elvis%20Presley%20after%20claiming%20he%27s%20%27banned%27%20from%20certain%20arenas&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkanye-west-compares-himself-to-elvis-presley-after-claiming-hes-banned-from-certain-arenas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkanye-west-compares-himself-to-elvis-presley-after-claiming-hes-banned-from-certain-arenas.html&title=Kanye%20West%20compares%20himself%20to%20Elvis%20Presley%20after%20claiming%20he%27s%20%27banned%27%20from%20certain%20arenas" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkanye-west-compares-himself-to-elvis-presley-after-claiming-hes-banned-from-certain-arenas.html&title=Kanye%20West%20compares%20himself%20to%20Elvis%20Presley%20after%20claiming%20he%27s%20%27banned%27%20from%20certain%20arenas" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkanye-west-compares-himself-to-elvis-presley-after-claiming-hes-banned-from-certain-arenas.html&title=Kanye%20West%20compares%20himself%20to%20Elvis%20Presley%20after%20claiming%20he%27s%20%27banned%27%20from%20certain%20arenas" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkanye-west-compares-himself-to-elvis-presley-after-claiming-hes-banned-from-certain-arenas.html&description=Kanye%20West%20compares%20himself%20to%20Elvis%20Presley%20after%20claiming%20he%27s%20%27banned%27%20from%20certain%20arenas" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brett-young-mercy-lyrics-uncovered.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lyrics Uncovered: Brett Young, 'Mercy'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./free-people-daisy-jones-the-six-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Free People's Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six collection: The best pieces to shop">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

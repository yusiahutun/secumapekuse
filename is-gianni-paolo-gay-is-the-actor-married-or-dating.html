They have also seen him getting romantically involved on the show, but does he have a girlfriend in real life? As rumored, is he gay?</p><p>Let’s get into detail to find out more about Gianni Paolo’s dating life.</p><h3><strong>Is Gianni Paolo Gay?</strong></h3><p>Rumor has been swirling that Gianni Paolo might be gay on the internet. Fans of the actor know that even though he is already famous, he keeps posting on TikTok like he is not. Via the platform, viewers get to interact with him and his co-star and best friend Michael Rainey Jr.</p><p>In August 2022, he made a <a href=#>TikTok</a> while replying to a fan. The fan had previously commented in another video, “I just want a girl to love me like Gi loves Mike.” Back in March 2022, Gianni made <a href=#>a video</a> with Michael with an on-screen caption, “when you’ve been at work for 8 hours and your co-worker starts lookin thicc AF.”</p><p>These types of subtle and funny videos likely ignited the rumor that he was gay. However, that doesn’t mean that he is gay. In fact, he has dated women in past suggesting that he is as straight as they come.</p><h3><strong>Is Gianni Paolo Married Or Dating?</strong></h3><p>The current relationship status of Gianni Paolo is unclear but he is definitely not married. Based on his socials, we can say that he is likely single or keeping his relationship away from the limelight.</p><p>Distractify noted that he previously did mention being with a girl. On Instagram, there is a picture of Gianni and actress Elsie Hewitt from May 2022, although they appear to be simply friends. It’s interesting to note that he once had a romantic interest in his life. The 26-year-old has frequently discussed dating a certain woman in the past on The Crew Has It podcast, which is hosted by Gianni and his co-star and best friend, Michael Rainey Jr.</p><p>Gianni expressed his happiness at being free of the relationship. Gianni’s ex-girlfriend’s identity <span>and the details of their relationship’s history are currently unclear. Gianni did reveal that he had a strong fondness for African-American women, in a recent episode of </span>The Crew Has It<span> where they had LightSkinKeisha over as a guest.</span></p><p>Sharing a similar theme, Gianni posted a <a href=#>TikTok</a> of how beautiful African-American women are falling for his best friend Michael. In the video, he states that he wants to be Michael one day. Fans of Power flooded the comment section replying to that TikTok.</p><p>One fan wrote, “We want you too baby.” Second chimed in, “but the black women love you to bray.” The third one added, “oh shawty you ain’t safe, we want you too!”</p><p>Gianni does have a lot of African-American fans. He is good-looking and plays the role of a major comic relief on the show, which makes him that much more entertaining to watch on the show.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Gianni Paolo?</strong></h3><p>Born on 27 May 1996, Gianni Paolo is 26 years old as of 2022.</p><h3><strong>Is Gianni Paolo Italian?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Gianni Paolo is of Italian heritage. While he hasn’t spoken much about his heritage, his brother Alex has stated on his <a href=#>IG bio</a> that he is Italian-American.</p><h3><strong>Gianni Paolo Parents</strong></h3><p>Gianni Paolo is one of the three sons of Dave Paolo and Kathleen “Kathy” Paolo. David is 55 years old being born in March 1968. In December 2022, Kathleen turned 59 years old. Kathleen celebrates her birthday on 22 December.</p><p>Gianni’s dad, Dave is currently working as a Chief Executive Officer at Skypath Security, Inc. since March 2018. He was a founder/president/CEO of Coin Theatres, Inc.</p><p>Gianni has two brothers <a href=#>Alex</a> and Christian Paolo.</p><p>Dave and Kathleen raised him in Scituate, Rhode Island. He played hockey for the most part of his life since he was 3. He told Daman Co Id, “My earliest memory of anything entertainment related was when I was about 9 years old. I just remember making all of my coaches and the other parents laugh and the kids didn’t get my jokes. They would say to me, “you shouldn’t be playing hockey, you should be on TV.” At the time I always thought they just wanted me to quit because I was competing with their kids, but who knew they were right.”</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Gianni Paolo Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Gianni Paolo’s net worth should likely surpass $600 thousand. The Rhode Island native spoke of starting his acting career during his interview. He explained, “I started acting when I was about 18 years old. I never had a time when I was younger to do anything because of my intense hockey schedule. But by the time I took my first theatre class in high school, I was hooked.”</p><p>Gianni added, “I just remember making jokes and being funny and the teacher was like, “Yes! More of that!” Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to stick with it, nor with any audition because I kept transferring to different hockey teams. Yet, I always knew it was what I wanted to do.”</p><p>Some of his notable shows are Arlo: The Burping Pig, Chance, The Mick, The Fosters, Power, and Ma&nbsp;among others.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Gianni Paolo Nationality?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Gianni Paolo’s nationality is American.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Gianni Paolo?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>With a chiseled look, Gianni Paolo stands tall above the height of 5 feet 9 inches.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Gianni Paolo Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Gianni Paolo’s birthday is on 27 May.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmoqtdnLaius2iZKmZn6G8brPAsmSiq12ptaZ5wJyrqKpdoq6zvsiem2anomKxosDIp55o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-gianni-paolo-gay-is-the-actor-married-or-dating.html&text=Is%20Gianni%20Paolo%20Gay%3f%20Is%20The%20Actor%20Married%20Or%20Dating%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-gianni-paolo-gay-is-the-actor-married-or-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-gianni-paolo-gay-is-the-actor-married-or-dating.html&title=Is%20Gianni%20Paolo%20Gay%3f%20Is%20The%20Actor%20Married%20Or%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-gianni-paolo-gay-is-the-actor-married-or-dating.html&title=Is%20Gianni%20Paolo%20Gay%3f%20Is%20The%20Actor%20Married%20Or%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-gianni-paolo-gay-is-the-actor-married-or-dating.html&title=Is%20Gianni%20Paolo%20Gay%3f%20Is%20The%20Actor%20Married%20Or%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-gianni-paolo-gay-is-the-actor-married-or-dating.html&description=Is%20Gianni%20Paolo%20Gay%3f%20Is%20The%20Actor%20Married%20Or%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./julie-andrews-kids-children-stepchildren-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julie Andrews Kids: Children, Stepchildren Details">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./heidi-watney.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heidi Watney Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
